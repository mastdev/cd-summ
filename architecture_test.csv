From a £27m art and design academy at Liverpool John Moores University to a multicoloured glass extension at Clapham Manor primary school, education buildings won almost a fifth of the RIBA's 93 awards in a feat that may not be repeated for a generation after the government ordered a moratorium on new plans for school buildings.

The new education secretary, Michael Gove, recently clashed with architects when he accused them of ""creaming off cash"" that should have been going to the frontline.

The RIBA roll of honour also reveals the damaging effect of recession on architectural opportunity: instead of the stadium, airport and museum projects of previous years, the 2010 list features more modest projects, including a bus drivers' toilet in Dagenham and a black-clad electricity sub-station on a 2012 Olympic site in east London. And, with house building falling to an 87-year low, just three housing schemes were granted awards.

Many of the country's leading designers, including Zaha Hadid, David Chipperfield and Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, won accolades for buildings elsewhere in the EU rather than at home. Hadid's expressionist angles and curves were reserved for Rome's museum of 21st-century art, MAXXI, while Lord Rogers, widely regarded as one of the world's leading modernists, designed a new headquarters campus for a Spanish technology company in Seville.

""The RIBA awards reflect not only the state of British architecture but also that of its economy,"" said Ruth Reed, the institute's president. ""In the midst of the deepest recession in the awards' 45-year history, this year demonstrates that, although times might be hard for architects, there are still great buildings being built throughout the country and overseas. The RIBA awards always give an opportunity for gem-like small projects and less established practices to shine through, and this year is no exception. Far from being a size prize, the RIBA awards are for buildings that offer value to people's lives.""

The memorial in Hyde Park to the victims of the 7 July 2005 bomb attacks on the London transport network, by Carmody Groarke, also won and is considered by some as a possible contender for the shortlist for the £20,000 Stirling prize for building of the year, which is drawn from the RIBA award winners.

Ellis Woodman, architecture critic at the newspaper Building Design, said that other strong Stirling prize contenders included the Nottingham contemporary arts centre, the new British embassy in Warsaw, the Neues Museum in Berlin, Christ's College school in Guildford and Hadid's MAXXI museum.

The Oregon-born architect Rick Mather won most awards, gaining four. Other winning buildings included a new home in Bristol for Wallace and Gromit's creators, Aardman Animations, and a cluster of foil-clad small-business units, which look like cybermen helmets, designed by Thomas Heatherwick, in Wales.",Fifth of RIBA's annual architecture plaudits go to education projects – but now cuts will bite,34.7647058824,0.6470588235,0.8823529412000001,medium,low,abstractive,architecture
http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/28/nyregion/mr-scully-s-architecture-class-is-dismissed.html,http://web.archive.org/web/20160525012754id_/http://www.nytimes.com:80/1991/04/28/nyregion/mr-scully-s-architecture-class-is-dismissed.html,Mr. Scully's Architecture Class Is Dismissed,1970-08-22 08:08:45.012754,"NEW HAVEN, April 27— Vincent Scully did not want to retire, but Yale University insisted, and so it was time for the last lecture of the class he started teaching in 1947. He was not expecting it to be all that different from the others until he arrived on Friday to see that the audience more or less constituted the course title: Modern Architecture.

Sitting there among the freshmen taking the introductory course was Philip Johnson, 85 years old, the designer of the A.T. & T. Building and so much else. Not far away was Maya Lin, 31, who designed the Vietnam War Memorial during her senior year at Yale in 1981. Scattered around the auditorium were dozens of other architects somewhere in between those two ages.

Their presence was probably best explained by David M. Childs, who is working on two of the largest current projects in Manhattan, at Columbus Circle and on Donald J. Trump's land along the Hudson River. Mr. Childs could not make it on Friday -- he was busy on a building in Brussels -- but he sent along a letter:

""Thirty years ago a sophomore pre-med student went to listen to a 53b lecture. One hour later, he decided to switch to a major in architecture. Thank you for changing my life.""

Mr. Scully took one look at the assemblage of architects, walked out the door to compose his thoughts and then came back to the stage. ""It's very hard to begin,"" he said. ""I'm simply very intimidated."" But then the lights went out, the slides came on and he was in his element.

Mr. Scully has put forth his theories in many media -- 15 books, countless articles, a series of public television programs that he narrated -- but it was his course lectures that made him, in Philip Johnson's words, ""the most influential architecture teacher ever."" The lectures consistently attracted hundreds of students, many not even taking the class, and they customarily ended with ovations.

The last one began quietly with talk about ""contextuality"" and ""healing the wounds that the modern age has inflicted upon our cities."" Slides appeared of new towns built during the last three decades in the suburbs of Paris -- places with lakes dotted with concrete islands -- and soon he was waving the wooden pointer in exasperation and rolling along in passionate cadences.

""They are without question . . . the most degraded setting for human life that mankind has ever managed to throw together,"" he said. ""So utterly and completely degraded. So utterly without any order, without community, without a sense of neighborhood. In some of these there aren't even any sidewalks.""

There were sounds in the audience. Mr. Scully had them moaning about sidewalks. He pointed to a row of houses covered with solar panels.

""Here is a fellow who wanted to do something about solar energy. So everything about his house has to do with the reception of light. What it does, of course, is utterly destroy the building's presence on the street."" The architect had forgotten about ""buildings all getting along with each other.""

""It looks like a world that's been chewed by rats,"" he said, and asked how a people who built Paris could have gone so wrong.

The answer came when pictures of another development appeared. Mr. Scully happened to be in some of the pictures, and he acknowledged his presence to be a lamentable distraction, but he explained, ""That's because they were taken by my wife, who, not being an architect, feels that human beings should be in the picture, too.""

The audience applauded, and afterward the visiting architects said the sentiment probably summed up Mr. Scully's career as well as anything.

""He gave you the feeling that architects should make a positive difference in people's lives,"" said Ms. Lin. ""He gave you a feeling of social responsibility, and it influenced me when I did the Vietnam Memorial. I wanted to do something that dealt not with politics or glory but that focused on individuals' experience.""

Mr. Scully was an early champion of historic preservation and crusaded against 1960's urban redevelopment schemes, particularly in New Haven, where he was born 70 years ago. He championed the work of Robert Venturi in the revolt against abstract modernism -- the glass boxes on the Avenue of the Americas -- which culminated in post-modern structures like Mr. Johnson's A.T. & T. Building. 'We All Want to Please Vince'

""His magnetic personality persuaded me time and time again,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""He opened our eyes.""

The visiting architects represented a wide variety of styles and buildings -- Cesar Pelli and the World Financial Center, Kevin Roche's wings at the Metropolitan Museum, Leon Krier and the new villages designed for Prince Charles -- but they had one thing in common, said Robert A. M. Stern.

""In some deep nefarious way we all want to please Vince,"" said Mr. Stern, whose shingle-style houses in the Hamptoms were inspired by ""The Shingle Style and the Stick Style,"" a book by Mr. Scully published in 1955. ""He's a high moralist, and he keeps reminding us of the high standards we have to live up to.""

Mr. Scully seemed uncomfortable with both their praise and with being honored upon his retirement. He had wanted to keep teaching, but Yale has mandatory retirement at age 70. He will have an emeritus position next year, in which he will teach a class, but not his famous introduction to modern architecture.

How did he feel when he got his first glimpse of the visiting architects?

""It was too much,"" he said. ""One wants to get through the last lecture without inflicting some terrible psychodrama of aging on the students. I was just hoping these guys don't break me down.""

In the first instance, the Architect's Journal announced the finalists for its inaugural Women in Architecture awards. The magazine's recent championing of female architects, and highlighting of inequalities within the profession, is commendable. Among its findings was that the proportion of female architectural staff in the UK has actually declined since 2009, from 28% to 21% – this despite the proportion of female architecture students being roughly 50%. That work-life balance is evidently hard to strike in a profession many say is still inherently masculine, with its long apprenticeship, long working hours, and emphasis on competition rather than collaboration. No wonder they've called it the WAA – it sounds like a cry of despair, doesn't it?

The shortlists aren't too depressing, though. Eight women are up for the award, including Amanda Levete (formerly of Future Systems, doing well on her own), Roisin Heneghan (of Heneghan Peng, designers of the new London Olympics footbridge) and Sarah Wigglesworth (whose fine Sandal Magna primary school gained her a lot of attention last year). There's also an award for emerging woman architect of the year. The prizes are announced on 20 April. There's a nice (if confusingly Anglo-American) infographic on women in architecture here, by the way.

The woman for whom it has not been such a great week is the first female architect most people would name: Zaha Hadid. She's up for the WAA as well, but first she lost out on the competition to design the prestigious new Bauhaus Museum in Weimer, Germany, for which she was the only British architect in contention. Her absence was conspicuous, too, when it came to another architecture award: the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) announced the 23-strong shortlist for its inaugural national awards this week, and Zaha's Glasgow Riverside Museum for Transport isn't on it, despite being surely the highest-profile new building in Scotland of the past year. It wasn't a unanimously popular project, but its omission has baffled even its critics. Was it because Zaha has won the Stirling prize for two years running? Has she just become too big?

Hadid can at least take consolation from her inclusion in the V&A's new exhibition on British design, which opens today. The exhibition's architecture component includes a model of her Aquatics Centre, the only female-designed building in the show, as far as I could see. There are plenty of the usual architectural suspects here: the postwar Festival of Britain generation; Basil Spence; Denys Lasdun; big models of Foster's Gherkin and Rogers's Lloyds building.

One discovery for me was John Prizeman, about whom I'd known very little. He was an accomplished writer, and his work mainly focused on domestic interiors, particularly kitchens. There are illustrations of two small designs by him that caught my eye. One was his ""Soft-Tech House for the 1980s"" – an evocative, late-70s vision of ""the future"" that looks like a cross between Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House and a sort of Hobbit-style eco-dwelling. It's somehow simultaneously quaint and ahead of its time.

The other, particularly pertinent in the context of women in architecture, is a cutaway illustration of a neat, compact family home Prizeman designed in 1959. It's bracingly modern, with fitted kitchens, free-flowing living areas and a new Mini in the garage, though its name wasn't exactly progressive: it's called Her House. It says it all that the woman in Prizeman's dream home is depicted bustling around indoors; the man is lounging on the back terrace.

Finally, another new discovery this week was Architects of Invention, a practice that not only has one of the best names in the business but looks to be living up to it. It is headed by Niko Japaridze, a former senior architect at Rem Koolhaas's OMA, who has worked in the UK and also has offices in his native Georgia. Last year, the firm wove a snaking wooden staircase through the new headquarters it designed for Georgia's National Olympic Committee, and has recently finished an imposing new building in Tbilisi with an imposing name: The Prosecutor's Office. It looks like a giant black filing cabinet, with square, glass rooms projecting out like half-opened drawers. Seventy per cent of the building is hung off the ground. The interior is just as startling – its long central staircase with green glass walls looks like something out of The Matrix. Japaridze has a host of other promising-looking buildings going up in Georgia. He also claims to be Tbilisi's one millionth citizen. One to watch.

Before ever meeting him in-person, Adam Besvinick landed a gig working with Lowercase Capital’s Chris Sacca, one of the most prolific investors in the country. The billionaire tech guru is known for his early bets on Twitter twitr and Uber as well as Instagram, Stripe, Twilio, and more. How did the then Harvard Business School student do it?

At our latest brunchwork startup workshop at LMHQ in NYC, Adam (now a Principal at Deep Fork Capital) discussed his philosophy of “providing value before asking for value,” and revealed three strategies that others can use to build valuable relationships in the startup world.

Adam caught Chris Sacca’s attention online. “I sent Chris blog posts, which I wrote, that I thought were relevant to his portfolio companies or to the things he was investing in,” Adam said. “I would tweet at him. I would email him companies that I thought he might consider interesting or worthwhile.”

When it comes to networking and introductions, Adam encouraged us not to underestimate the importance of offline avenues. “A lot can be done over the phone, email and Hangouts,” Adam said. “I’ve actually only met Chris twice in-person in four years of working with him.”

Digital etiquette is important. While responding to every email may seem daunting, Adam makes it a point to do so. “Everyone acknowledges, respects and appreciates a response. I reply to literally every single email that I get from a founder.”

2. Know each investor’s individual interests.

Research individual investors and not just their investment firm. “You think every investor is going to be interested in the company that you are building,” Adam said.

“The biggest mistake a lot of founders make is that they think every investor is the same.”

That’s not the case. Instead, Adam said, “Every investor has certain metrics or qualities that they place a higher emphasis on.” Entrepreneurs need to identify those qualities for each investor and determine if they match them.

3. Build relationships before you need to.

Adam’s most important pieces of advice for founders: “Reach out to investors before you’re ready to raise,” he said.“The worst time to get to know someone is when you actually need to know them.”

Building investor relationships takes time. By getting to know investors early on, you can “get feedback on what you’re building [and] try to build a relationship and a dialogue with them leading up to when you actually need their capital,” Adam said.",Start with these three strategies,103.2,0.6000000000000001,1.0,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Photograph: James Brittain

Wales claims to have been ""the world's first industrial nation"". If the number of museums relating to Wales' industrial heritage is any measure, it has now become the world's most advanced post-industrial state. You'd expect a substantial amount of industry to be on display in institutions such as Cardiff's Museum of Welsh Life, but there are also national museums dedicated to coal mining, woollen and slate industries, plus numerous decommissioned industrial sites that have been converted into heritage parks and the like. Perhaps in some future museum of 21st-century Welsh life, there'll be an exhibition about the current craze for museum building.

Now we have the new £30m National Waterfront Museum, which opens in Swansea tomorrow, and aims to tell ""Wales's story of industry and innovation"". It sounds like the last thing the country needs, but this new institution is a welcome arrival. That's partly because it combines two existing facilities - Cardiff's Welsh Industrial and Maritime Museum, and Swansea's Maritime and Industrial Museum, thus reducing the total number of museums - but primarily because it is a piece of quality architecture in Wales's second city.

Swansea could certainly do with an image makeover. The Lonely Planet guide described it as ""an ashtray of a place"", the movie Twin Town called it ""a pretty shitty city"", and even native son Dylan Thomas damned it as ""a graveyard of ambition"". In the post-industrial world, the city's most notable export has been Catherine Zeta Jones. Added to which, the flag-waving structures of recent years - Richard Rogers's Welsh National Assembly, the Wales Millennium Centre, and the Millennium Stadium - have all gone to Cardiff. Scarred by heavy industry and second world war bombing, much of Swansea is a jumble of old industrial buildings, decaying modern office blocks and cheap new commercial buildings resembling giant Travelodges. Despite its location on a beautiful bay, it's often difficult to guess the city is anywhere near the sea. Even in the former dockyards to the south, where the National Waterfront Museum is located, a 1970s housing development completely blocks the view to Swansea Bay. The ""waterfront"" of the title refers to a basin 100m inland.

""I hate the phrase 'catalyst for regeneration', but this is one of those projects that is trying to do an awful lot for an area that needs moving along,"" says Martin Knight of architects Wilkinson Eyre, best known for their acclaimed ""winking"" Millennium Bridge in Gateshead. That Stirling prize-winning project has become the symbol of a rejuvenated Tyneside, and Wilkinson Eyre's presence here, in another post-industrial port city, suggests Swansea is ready for its own ""Gateshead effect"". There is even another striking Wilkinson Eyre footbridge - the Swansea Sail Bridge - just around the corner from the new museum. ""You probably haven't got enough to make a quarter or a district like they did there, but there's a framework you can build on,"" says Knight. ""The main thing is to make a new heart for this area that will tie into the existing building stock.""

The former Swansea Maritime and Industrial Museum occupied a two-storey brick warehouse alongside the basin. This area was once a rail yard, but in recent times it has been a huge car park serving the leisure centre next door - a hulking 1970s box now closed for refurbishment. Echoing the goods carriages that once pulled through here, the new section of the museum adds a curving series of four interlocked steel and glass cubes, peeling away from the warehouse building. Joining the old and new components together is a glazed internal street that forms an axis running from the basin, through the museum and its grounds, and back into the city centre. The architects have tried to forge a direct connection between the city and the sea with this new axis. If someone were to demolish the 1970s houses across the basin, the job would be complete. ""We've done the best we possibly can,"" says Knight.

Approaching the museum along this new route, the translucent boxes hardly feel like a spectacular climax - some have even compared them uncharitably to a business park - but it was more important to build a flexible, practical building than a local icon, say the architects, especially for a museum concerned with industry.

The facade looking away from the city, however, is more of a show-stealer. It is clad in heavy Welsh slate - vertical slices of it arranged in irregular horizontal bands that imitate the glass on the other side. It has become almost a cliche to use slate as shorthand for Welshness - the new Welsh National Assembly and the Wales Millennium Centre also bring out the Welsh slate, the former as a heavy plinth, the latter in a sort of dry-stone wall pastiche - but this is arguably the most successful. The effect is contemporary but warm. Set off by aluminium channels between them, the slate panels' colour and surface textures change with variations in the light and weather.

""We wanted to use the widest variety of Welsh quarries we could,"" Knight explains, ""and make this really representative, but in the end we could only find two that could deal with the logistics of the programme and the budget. Part of the problem was that smaller suppliers are geared more towards doing headstones.""

On the inside, the architecture takes a back seat to the exhibitions, which were created by specialists Land Design. As you'd expect, there are a few big pieces of machinery, but the museum's emphasis is more on the social history of industrial Wales. There is no single point of entry, but it is hoped visitors will be led up a giant new staircase to the first floor of the old warehouse. Here, the displays begin with a wall-sized live panorama of the city, followed by an interactive exhibit based on the 1851 census (the first to show that industrial workers outnumbered agricultural workers, and the basis of the ""first industrial nation"" claim).

The route then opens out into the main volume of the old warehouse, which has been stripped back as far as possible to reveal the original roof structure, before winding across a mezzanine bridge into the new building, and down to the open hall housing the big machines (tilt hammers, steam engines and the like). Here, Wilkinson Eyre's expertise with bridges pays off; the heavy steel elements supporting the external glass complement the exhibits. Lastly, there is a separate and rather forlorn little room projecting the industrial narrative into the future with some virtual exhibits on Wales's new growth industries, such as nanotechnology and renewable energy.

If there's one lesson the millennial rush of new museums has hammered home, particularly those that have failed after a couple of years, it's that the numbers have to add up, both in terms of visitors and revenue. Whatever it brings to the city and its people, the National Waterfront Museum (which will be free to all visitors) must also generate cash to stay alive. Perhaps it's not even accurate to describe such a building as a museum. Most of the old warehouse building's ground floor is given over to commercial space: a museum shop and café inside, plus units for external bars and restaurants that will come into life after the school coach trips have gone home. It is also hoped that the grand upstairs gallery of the warehouse will double as a venue for the hosting of corporate events. The display cases are designed to slide back to the perimeter of the room on rollers, creating space for a 200-person banquet. So as much as cataloguing the past, this is a museum that might point Swansea towards the future. If the end result is a revitalised cultural destination for the city, the slurs about ashtrays and graveyards could become history too.","With its sleek new museum, built by 'winking-eye bridge' architects Wilkinson Eyre, Swansea may yet become the next Gateshead, says Steve Rose.",52.0666666667,0.7666666667,1.3,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Today’s answer to the question “How do you build a strong team?” is written by Brian Smith, chief wine officer at Winc.

The quality I always look for in individuals is the same quality that I would hope to get out of a high-performance team: intuition. Those who have intuition are more equipped to see opportunities, find an optimal solution, and innovate, all while understanding their partner’s positions or motives. It is an awareness that makes people more creative, effective, and generally more fun to work with.

In order to pinpoint intuition, I look for people who may have started something on their own, even if it has failed. It’s more about taking initiative, seeing the landscape, and trying to find a niche solution or opportunity. I always like to ask, “When was the last time that you created something you were proud of?” It’s a classic interview question for me, regardless of the role.

Once you have some incredible people on your team, the next steps are to get aligned and stay connected. Alignment and connectivity are the pillars for success on any team. Not only do people need to embrace and understand the big goals, but they need to embrace consistent communication and maintain focus to increase the probability of hitting those goals.

See also: Why Hiring Just for Experience Is a Really Bad Idea

For most of us, it’s nearly impossible to step away from the day-to-day action, but I have become a huge believer in getting offsite. It’s amazing what a change of scenery and a bare-bones agenda can get you. These are often the greatest opportunities for strategic alignment, deeper understanding, and innovation as a team. At a recent offsite, we encouraged the team to challenge the status quo. One of our team members came up with the idea to change the way we packaged our wine, and we ended up saving a few hundred thousand dollars in addition to significantly reducing our environmental impact. You can’t get to these types of ideas if you don’t provide your team with a free and open environment to put everything on the table.

Once you have the big goals and initiatives, it all comes down to execution. This is hard, especially in the winemaking business. For about a third of the year, I’m in remote vineyards all over the world, and the days are long. Travel like this completely takes me away from day-to-day communication with my team. But spending time in the market or in the vineyards with purveyors, customers, growers, and winemakers is invaluable to informing my point of view.

To stay connected while I’m traveling, I try to schedule a 30-minute touch-base meeting with each leader every week. We leverage 15Five, which is a great tool for recapping the week’s wins, losses, near-term goals, and challenges.

Hire intuitive people, build a strategy together, and have a clear system for achieving success. To me, this is the foundation for a successful team. If you can throw in a little passion and fun, the sky is the limit.",You can't run a successful business without a strong team behind it.,46.2142857143,0.7142857143,1.4285714286,high,low,abstractive,architecture

How did the Irish-Scots aristocrat from Enniscorthy, County Wexford, become an originator of Parisian art deco? Even stranger, how, without any training as an architect, did she reinvent herself as one of the superstars of quite a different style, the architect of modernist buildings of a reticence so powerful they take the breath away? The answer must lie in Gray's exceptional contrariness as a woman and as an artist. ""To create,"" she once said, ""one must first question everything.""

There is a sense of metamorphosis in Gray's work. Her rooms are designed to be flexible, impermanent, responsive to the demands of the moment. Screens can be shifted to redefine the spaces. Little drawers pivot outwards to reveal their inner contents. A storage cupboard drops down to provide a writing surface. A mirror is suspended on a pole that swivels. All is movement, realignment, possibility.

The same is true of Gray's life. She was a springer of surprises. To start with, Gray, who took the lead in redefining architecture as a plausible profession for her sex, derives her surname not from her father but her mother, who in 1895 inherited the Scottish title Baroness Gray in her own right. Her father changed his name to Smith-Gray by royal licence and the four children were from then on known as Gray.

The unlikeliness continues with her choice of lacquer-making, an obscure oriental art that is technically hard to master, at a time when her contemporary craftswomen were concentrating on more conventional pursuits: bookbinding, weaving, embroidery, jewellery making. Nor was Gray ever involved in the arts and crafts guilds or supportive female groupings of the early 1900s. She always worked alone, and this fastidious apartness was the basis of her originality.

She studied at the Slade School of Design, but did not stay in England long. She had a wonderful ability to pack up and leave with no sentimental waverings. Gray had first gone to Paris in 1901, with two friends from the Slade, to take classes in drawing and returned to Paris permanently five years later, moving into the apartment in rue Bonaparte that she kept all her life. She was soon more Parisian than the Parisians, developing a style of decoration that came to be seen as quintessentially French.

Eileen Gray's work in Paris before the first world war is rarefied, exotic. She developed her skills in lacquer through meeting and learning from a young Japanese craftsman, Seizo Sugawara, who came from Jahoji, a village in northern Japan famous for its lacquer work. Gray filled her notebooks with colour recipes and methods of applying and layering the lacquer, seeing how she might draw on these ancient techniques to create a modern art form. Her screens and panels are abstract, with complex, swirling forms. The most marvellous of these, Le Destin (1914), is a four-fold screen in deep red lacquer on which a mysterious drama is enacted between two blue-grey naked youths and an old man wrapped in a misty silver shroud. Le Destin was acquired by the couturier Jacques Doucet, bibliophile and modern art collector, an early admirer of Gray's work.

After the war her interiors still tended to the sumptuous, though never to the vulgar. Gray's art deco was never lush or louche. She had a deeply moral disapproval of the overdone, covering over the ""disgraceful mouldings"" in the apartment in the Rue de Lota she was commissioned to design for Madame Mathieu Lévy, who, as Suzanne Talbot, was one of the most fashionable modistes in Paris at the time. Gray had been excited by Bakst's designs for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, and the salon in the Lévy apartment is her own Schéhérazade, a finely judged ensemble of lacquered panels, matt gold cushions, a red lacquer serpent chair and one of her most beautiful designs, the Pirogue boat-bed, burnished like a barque for Cleopatra in lacquer and silver leaf. (The Pirogue was the show-stopper in the V&A museum's art deco exhibition of 2003.)

Very little is known of Gray's emotional life. Characteristically, she burnt all letters and personal mementoes in old age. But it seems that from her early years in France, Gray was on the fringes of the raffish intellectual Paris-Lesbos scene. She had a long, close friendship with Gaby Bloch, companion-manager of the American Marie Louise Fuller, alias Loïe, of twirling dance celebrity. She was later to be seen swanning around with Damia, the green-eyed, gravel-voiced singer whose popular ""chansons dramatiques et tristes"" had made her the Edith Piaf of her day. Gray escorted Damia to restaurants and nightclubs, elegant in her Poiret evening coats and Lanvin hats. She knew Nathalie Barney, Romaine Brooks and Gertrude Stein. But she never quite joined up with the Café Flore society of Americans in Paris. They were probably too raucous. The American photographer Thérèse Bonney recalled Gray's extreme inwardness: ""Of all the people I knew in the world, she gave the feeling of complete consecration.""

Gray's rebirth as total modernist began in the mid-1920s. By now she had opened her own shop in Paris, in the fashionable Rue du Faubourg St Honoré. The shop was called Galérie Jean Désert, the name of an invented male proprietor and reference to Gray's then-recent desert travels in north Africa with the weaver Evelyn Wyld. A female furniture designer in Paris was a rarity, but a cognoscenti customer base of writers, politicians, artists and architects was gradually created. Jean Désert sold the abstract geometric rugs designed by Gray and woven in Wyld's Rue Visconti workshops.

Her evolution was now recognised by other European modernists. Gray had her first major public showing in the Salon des Artistes Décorateurs in 1923. Although the sombrely sophisticated Bedroom-Boudoir de Monte Carlo was described by one critic as suitable for Dr Caligari's daughter, Gray was heartened to receive an enthusiastic postcard from the Dutch modernist architect JP Oud, a founder of De Stijl. Her subsequent display at the Salon d'Automne was praised by her fellow exhibitors Le Corbusier and Robert Mallet-Stevens. In 1924 the Dutch avant-garde magazine Wendingen referred to her as being ""at the centre of the modern movement"". She was seen as a designer with new visions for the future, demonstrating that ""the formidable influence of technology has transformed our sensibilities"".

Gray was the model of the self-made architect: ""I started really by myself, sort of making plans of buildings."" Her architecture evolved without the training or the tradition of the large office. She was never the woman in the shadow of the maestro, as Charlotte Perriand was with Le Corbusier or Lilly Reich with Mies van der Rohe. Her first house, named cryptically E-1027, was designed in collaboration with and indeed for her sometime lover, Jean Badovici, the Romanian architect and writer. But she did not allow him to get the upper hand. The plan was credited to ""Eileen Gray and Jean Badovici"". When the design was shown in a later exhibition as the work of Badovici with furnishings by Gray, on the assumption that women were by nature merely choosers of the curtains, she was understandably enraged.

E-1027 was built on the cliffs at Roquebrune, a clear white L-shaped house of exquisite simplicity. The south of France was then a favoured place for modernists, with its wild coast scenery and connotations of escape. Gray had loved the Riviera since she first discovered St Tropez, then quite undeveloped, on her early travels before the first world war. E-1027 developed as a ""living organism"", like the flora and fauna burgeoning around it. The furnishings were integral to the architecture, in Gray's apparently casual seaside ""camping style"". Most of the furniture for which Gray is now so famous - the Bibendum chair, the Transat chair - was designed for the new house. The E-1027 circular glass table, adjustable in height by means of a sliding pole, was evolved for Eileen's sister, who liked breakfasting in bed.

Though E-1027 was startlingly modern in its day, Gray was never a doctrinaire modernist. She stood apart from the dogmatic male dominated Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM). What she achieved was different, and it was her own. Colin St John Wilson, architect of the British library and a Gray aficionado, has defined her ""unique gift for turning the practical into the poetic"", her intense ""perceptions of habitability"". Gray took the forms of modernism and invested them with a perfectionist tendresse. In the hall of E-1027, ""Entrez Lentement"" was spelled out with a kind of gentle jokiness. When she used industrial materials it was with the lightest touch. This makes all the crasser Le Corbusier's later desecration of E-1027 by painting nine large, lewdly coloured frescoes on the pristine walls, an act Gray called violation. Le Corbusier reputedly added insult to injury by painting in the nude.

Between 1932 and 1934 Gray built her own house, Tempe à Pailla, nearby at Castellar. She and Jean Badovici had by now parted. Gray continued planning buildings but little materialised.

It was only in the 1970s that Gray was rediscovered. Retrospectives in London and New York revealed her as a designer of intrepid intelligence. She attracted younger fans, among them Bruce Chatwin, who tracked her down in Paris. He remarked on two gouache maps of Patagonia she had painted on the walls of her apartment. Gray, by then old, blind and fragile, said: ""Go there for me."" When Chatwin returned, he wrote In Patagonia. Gray died in 1976 at the age of 98.

Can we really consider her as one of the giants of modernism on the strength of just two buildings? Gray herself, who regarded her late fame with a charming cynicism, would have said: ""Mais c'est absurde."" Yet her vision of the future - ""the future projects light, the past only shadows"" - was compelling. She humanised the architectural world. We need to see her as the precursor of such solo women architects as Eva Jiricna and Zaha Hadid. View Gray in broader terms as the builder of the home, literally the homemaker, and you have a potent image for the dawning feminism of the mid-20th century.

WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Tuesday told China Construction Bank Corp to ramp up its anti-money laundering framework, the first enforcement action by the U.S. central bank against one of China's four largest state-owned banks.

Within 60 days, the bank should submit plans for compliance programs for anti-money laundering controls, customer due diligence programs, and methods for spotting suspicious transactions, the Fed said.

Mildred Harper, chief compliance officer for CCB's New York branch, confirmed the enforcement action.

It is the first time the Fed has taken an enforcement action against CCB, according to the Fed's website, where a database showed no similar enforcement actions for any of the three other large Chinese banks: Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China.

The Fed did not impose a fine or other sanctions on the bank, and did not identify what problems CCB was facing.

A tough U.S. policy has found high-profile violators among banks failing to enforce compliance in recent years.

In July, 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to two criminal charges and agreed to pay almost $9 billion to resolve accusations it violated U.S. sanctions against countries such as Sudan, Cuba and Iran.

Late in 2012, HSBC Holdings Plc paid a $1.9 billion fine to U.S. authorities, a record at the time, for allowing itself to be used to launder drug money from Mexico's Sinaloa cartel and Colombia's Norte del Valle cartel.

Today’s answer for: How do you build a strong team? is written by Kathy Bloomgarden, CEO of Ruder Finn.

Business these days requires a team mentality, as the workplace increasingly depends on collaboration, common goals and embracing shared values. But in order to really drive success, we must move beyond ‘group think’ and focus on how we’re going to establish a killer team that doesn’t shy away from bumps in the road.

Hand over the leadership reigns The most unproductive meetings are those where there are too many strongly opinionated leaders, with no one individual willing to take charge, drown out the noise and set a path forward. Often the success of the team is about getting beyond the circular discussions (we’ve all been a part of them!) and taking action. This requires handing over the reigns to someone hungry and not afraid to make quick, hard decisions and keep the team moving.

Set aggressive goals I’ve learned that a key reason for employee turnover is boredom. If you put individuals in one position for too long, they will eventually feel ‘stuck’ and are more easily lured by new opportunities, especially the millennial generation. It’s important to work with each person to set aggressive yet realistic goals for growth, and arm employees with a hungry team willing to achieve them. If employees are encouraged to be part of a team that sets tough targets they will fell stimulated, challenged, and part of something important.

Empower your teams to own it Once aggressive goals have been established teams need to own what they sign up for. This means driving projects that produce results, giving tough love when necessary and speaking up when there are issues. When each member of the team feels personally invested in the goal they are working to achieve, amazing things are possible.

Decontamination is set to resume at the Deutsche Bank building within days and the construction of two out of three World Trade Center skyscrapers began last week. “There has not been this much going on at the site since the cleanup concluded almost six years ago,” said developer Larry Silverstein in a speech.

The rebirth of the two sites—those that once housed the World Trade Center and the Deutsche Bank building – represent just the latest reinvention of one of Manhattan’s longest-settled areas. It’s also a reminder that, in New York, rebirth and renovation are recurring processes. Under the Deutsche Bank building, for example, resides a lot of not-quite-buried history.

Before 9/11, the World Trade Center was condemned by some for destroying a thriving neighborhood of small electronics shops known as Radio Row. What became 1 Bankers Trust Plaza (and later, the Deutsche Bank building after the German corporation acquired Bankers Trust) contributed further destruction: Two blocks largely filled with venerable four- and five-story walk-ups, most of them with mom-and-pop businesses on the ground floor, were demolished to build it. And while Radio Row extended to the site’s northern tip, the rest of the plot was situated in a neighborhood of a different character.

The New York Times surveyed the environs in a 1971 article describing the construction of the World Trade Center and the Bankers Trust Tower. The article noted, for example, a bar on Cedar Street (a block of which would disappear under the bank’s structure) that was serving “45-cent gin specials to take advantage of the big daytime trade from construction workers.” The adjacent street was filled with “saloons with quick-lunch steam tables, a variety of shops, an ale house, [and] the back of the American Stock Exchange.” (The latter still stands.)

One local restaurant owner waxed nostalgic about the “great hole being gouged out” for Bankers Trust because he had been born on the very spot: “I remember it was a coldwater walk-up flat with wood stove and everybody had separate private toilets outside in the yard,” he told the Times. “And the kids in the summer would go down to South Ferry and swim in the buff.”

In the earliest days of Manhattan, swimming would have been easy at the site of the Bankers Trust tower: At least part of the lot was located in the Hudson River. In New York’s earliest years, the city sold parcels of land that were under water at high tide but more or less dry at low tide, according to Ann Buttenweiser’s Manhattan Water-Bound: Manhattan’s Waterfront From the Seventeenth Century to the Present. Despite the plentiful space on the island, it was common to buy such plots and then bolster them with landfill. And so the earliest existing property record for the block that would one day hold the Bankers Trust building is a “indenture” from 1704 which describes the spot as located “without the north gate of the City of New Yorke bounded… in the West by the Hudson’s River at low water mark…”

By the 1820s, the future bank site had been fully converted to dry land and subdivided. But it wasn’t a high-rent district. For decades, owing to its proximity to the end of the island, it was a place where new arrivals and immigrants put down their bags before moving to more permanent lodging. Edgar Alan Poe, for example, briefly rented a room in a boarding house on the site in 1844 before moving uptown.

The arrival of the first elevated train in Manhattan, which ran north along the plot, didn’t improve the atmosphere. From 1870 until it was taken down in 1940, what became the Ninth Avenue El made the area noisy, dark and forbidding. Little surprise, perhaps, that illegal operations seemed to flourish in the area.

In the 1930s and 40s, references to the future Bankers Trust location turned up regularly in the Times, which reported raids on speakeasies, a fraud artist who “out-Ponzied Ponzi,” and an illegal horse-betting operation that went by the name of the “Paragon Institute of Raceology.” One of the more colorful examples appeared on October 2, 1942: “Nine men were arrested … in what the police called a ‘million-dollar-a-year wire service for poolroom bookmakers and other gamblers on horse racing…” The ringleader was Thomas J. Ryan, “a former member of the notorious Purple Gang of prohibition bootleggers and other criminals from Detroit and former muscle man for the late Moses L. Annenberg…” According to the article, Ryan had been warned of the impending raid, but said he wasn’t worried about it. “Big Shot Ryan made remarks over the phone that he wasn’t afraid of anyone,” a deputy police chief exulted, “but when we went there this morning he was hiding in a closet with a secret telephone, with a valise all packed ready to leave the city, and $16,000 in cash.”

It wasn’t all gangsters. A couple of blocks south, for decades, was what the 1939 WPA Guide to New York City referred to as the Syrian quarter. As the Guide put it, “although the fez has given way to the snap-brim, and the narghile has been abandoned for cigarettes, the coffee houses and the tobacco and confectionery shops of the Levantines still remain.” It was a vibrant neighborhood where baklava and shish kebab, then considered exotic foods, could be found – a small cultural foothold just a few blocks from Wall Street, the citadel of American capitalism.

St Paul's cathedral, across the river, seems close enough to touch. It's the kind of view, and the kind of heroically stylised building, you would expect to see in some 1930s sci-fi movie: the perfect place for a hero and a villain to have a rooftop showdown.

At 147 metres, the newly opened Strata is London's tallest residential building. The nine-metre blades I'm standing beneath are housed in one of three wind turbines that crown this new tower soaring above Elephant and Castle, an area of the city not known for flashy penthouses. But Elephant and Castle is undergoing a massive, if slow, transition from a rundown miasma of noisy road intersections, underpasses and vast housing estates into what the Borough of Southwark hopes will be a £1.5bn model of inner-city regeneration.

The plan was first made public six years ago and work is unlikely to be completed before 2020. It's a colossal challenge, as well as an opportunity, and the £113.5m Strata, the first of three skyscrapers planned for here, is a symbol of the dynamism and energy the project demands. And that energy must, of course, be seen to be green. It's early days, but if the turbines work as planned, and aren't too noisy for residents in the pricey penthouses beneath them, they should generate 8% of this 43-storey building's energy needs. This is roughly enough to run its electrical and mechanical services (including three express lifts and automated window-cleaning rigs) as well as the lighting, heating and ventilation of its public spaces, which include an underground car and cycle park.

Strata is the first building in the world to incorporate wind turbines into its structure. Yes, the new Bahrain World Trade Centre in Manama, by the firm Atkins, also boasts three giant turbines, but these are set on steel struts connecting its twin towers, not part of the actual towers themselves. While I can vouch for the strength of the south-westerlies that will turn Strata's blades, whether its turbines will set a precedent for future British towers is less clear: this rooftop was exceedingly hard to construct, almost prohibitively so, every part of it having to be hauled up.

However, what the three fans do, without a doubt, is give Strata a striking profile. Whether you find this exciting, disturbing or simply over-the-top will be down to personal taste, yet it's no surprise the tower has been dubbed the Electric Razor, not just because of its whirling blades but also because of its black and silver lines that seem to pixellate upwards; Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, has called it the Lipstick.

So what do green experts think? ""You've got to take your hat off to the design team for delivering a building that captures the imagination,"" says Paul King, head of the UK Green Building Council. ""I doubt wind power will become a common feature in high-rise inner city projects, but without this type of bold innovation, how would we ever know? Developments like this show that sustainability is increasingly becoming mainstream. That's something everyone should celebrate.""

Including the 1,000 or so people who have already moved into – or bought into – Strata's 408 flats (each boasting floor-to-ceiling windows). And there is a difference between the two. Nearly every flat was bought off-plan, before construction began, 50-75% of them by investors. This is a shame: the whole idea of the tower is that it should be a guiding light for new inner-city residential development. This is meant to be a home for local people, not a machine for property market profiteering.

Indeed, 25% of the flats, on floors two to 10, are ""affordable homes"", for those on incomes of less than £60,000 (in central London that kind of money won't guarantee a home of your own); meanwhile, a three-floor pavilion to the side of the tower has been given to council residents leaving the soon-to-be-demolished Aylesbury Estate, a 1960s housing complex seen by most as an enormous failure. Tony Blair made his first speech as prime minister at this estate, in a bid to show his government would care for the poorest elements in society.

To my mind, Strata's big propellers give the building the feel of an airship holding aloft the passenger cabins (or flats) below. Or perhaps it's more like an old-fashioned transatlantic liner with its complement of first-, second-and third-class passengers. I think of this as architect Ian Bogle, of London-based BFLS (formerly Hamiltons Architects), leads me through the tall, narrow lobby to the lifts that shoot silently up to the residential floors.

'You feel like you own the city'

The views are spectacular. Most front doors open directly onto gaping vistas of London, framed by giant windows. They are not for the faint-hearted. Bogle goes to open what looks like a door at the side of a window and I think he might vanish into the ether. As it happens, he's simply opening a perforated screen designed to let fresh air in. ""We've tried to get as much daylight and fresh air as possible into the flats,"" says Bogle. ""You certainly feel as if you own the entire city from up here.""

Indeed you do. There are magic moments, too: way below, trains race in and out of buildings and seem to pass through the tower itself. It reminds me of the super-modern city drawn by Antonio Sant'Elia, the Italian futurist architect, shortly before the first world war. His Città Nuova was a dynamic, machine-like metropolis through which cars and even aircraft would pass, via openings in the buildings. His imaginings inspired film-makers, from William Cameron Menzie's Things to Come in 1936, to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner in 1982; they also resonated in city developments as dramatic and diverse as the Barbican, the Pompidou and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. And they echo today in these views from the Strata tower, and in its mighty turbines.

But are they just a tokenistic green gimmick? Or will they propel us towards a new urban architecture, one that's cinematically thrilling and ecologically sound? Until its sibling towers rise and the redevelopment of Elephant and Castle is complete, it will be hard to properly judge Strata. Right now, it stands alone, a sleek silver sentinel, towering over the follies of the recent past.",It is the world's first skyscraper with built-in wind turbines.

But even London’s great estates can’t survive on historic prestige alone. They need to move with the times and morph into dynamic “urban villages” where people want to live, work and shop.

“Stewardship” is the key concept, according to Hugh Seaborn, CEO of Cadogan Estates, Chelsea and Knightsbridge’s main landlords who are currently overhauling Sloane Street by upping its luxury retail reputation and introducing multi-lingual ""ambassadors"" to guide visitors along the street. “Stewardship is about managing something for the benefit of future generations, while ensuring they meet the needs of the present generation,” says Seaborn.

Most of London’s biggest land-owners take as their inspiration the Howard de Walden estate’s transformation of Marylebone High Street. In 1995, a third of the street’s shops were either vacant or occupied by charities. In went Waitrose, Conran and small, specialist shops, the Georgian buildings got a thorough jet-spray and now Marylebone is one of the most sought-after residential and commercial areas of central London, where property values has risen by 128 per cent since 2000, according to Martin Bikhit, MD of Kay & Co estate agency.

Seeking to emulate its success – and bring its property values in line, having traditionally been about 15 per cent lower – The Portman Estate, which owns 110 acres of prime Marylebone, has invested millions in developing Portman Village around New Quebec Street. “They’re keen to monitor the tenant mix, granting five-year leases which give them the flexibility to make changes and ensure the long-term success of the area,” says Bikhit. “Now flats in the Portman Estate’s three main squares – Montagu, Portman and Bryanston – costs 22 per cent more than anywhere else in the local area.”

Also imitating the Marylebone model, Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster’s estate, worked its magic on Mayfair’s Mount Street – which is hailed as another stellar example of how to breathe new life into old estates.

“They cobbled and shined up Mount Street, inventing a new centrepiece for Mayfair,” says Roarie Scarisbrick, partner at buying agents Property Vision. “This has been repeated on Motcomb Street and Elizabeth Street, where you can browse the local artisan shops and get an excellent lunch from an eye-wateringly expensive delicatessen. It isn’t a model that would work everywhere, but this is what people want here, and the effect is clear to see.”

Grosvenor are the most “pioneering” of the great estates, according to Ed Tryon at Lichfields, a prime central London property search company. “They have cottoned on to the fashionable pop-up trend and fill empty shops with spaces for up-and-coming designers and artists before the permanent tenants move in,” he says. “Having created a community through the Mount Street Association and the Mount Street Garden Party, they have created a mini destination just around that one street and that is a sure-fire way to improve house prices.”

Now Grosvenor’s focus is North Mayfair, around Oxford Street, including 16 apartments to let at 65 Duke Street and trendy new retail tenants to be announced next month, all sitting in the sightline of Selfridges. The vision also includes The Beaumont, the first hotel to be operated by restaurateurs Corbin + King.

In St James, south of Piccadilly, The Crown Estate has recently launched a £500m programme that will partly hark back to its history as a place for fine dining, with five new restaurants to open before Christmas, including Angela Hartnett’s Café Murano. The historic St James Gateway is also being redeveloped to include 11 flats to let and five for sale, with 125-year leases, from £3.95m through WA Ellis.

But most excitingly, thinks buying agent Robert Bailey, is the Sultan of Brunei’s purchase of most of Queensway in Bayswater, including the white elephant that is Whiteley’s shopping centre. With Marylebone’s makeover as his inspiration, the Sultan wants to turn the strip of takeaways and mobile phone shops into a cluster of upmarket retailers.

“The Howard de Walden estate has already proved that if you can get the retail mix right along the main shopping streets, the area will transform,” says Bailey. “With enough vision, the Sultan could easily replicate the successes of Marylebone, Grosvenor’s Motcomb Street and Cadogan’s revitalisation of Sloane Street and create another great London estate.”","Historic fiefdoms continue to innovate, creating desirable urban villages with a pioneering mix of retail and restaurant developments",47.1052631579,0.7368421053,0.8421052632,high,low,abstractive,architecture

The Boston buildings are 225 Franklin St., a 33-story building that currently has an occupancy rate of 96 percent, and 60 State St., a 38-story building that is 82 percent leased. The Cambridge building is the 17-story One Memorial Drive.

On its own, Toronto-based Oxford said it purchased the 22-story office building at Boston’s 125 Summer St.

Oxford’s press release did not include financial details of the transaction. But a Globe story in May valued the sales agreement at $2.1 billion and identified the seller as Blackstone Group of New York.

In a statement, Oxford Properties senior vice president Andrew Trickett said: “Opportunities to acquire such a high-quality office portfolio in downtown Boston and Cambridge are extremely rare. We believe Boston has significant potential for rental growth and that the office market enjoys favorable supply/demand dynamics. By leveraging our scale and experience, Oxford was able to secure this transaction and quickly establish a substantial presence in a key US market which allows us to deliver on our strategic US regional initiative to acquire and develop significant holdings in New York, Washington D.C., and Boston.”",Oxford Properties and J.P.

Newly completed, these eight man-made hills have been shaped by the distinguished US critic, polemicist and designer Charles Jencks. Beautiful things, they rise in stepped ramps sheathed in emerald green turf, clustered around swirling ponds.

Last week, I climbed and sat on top of the tallest of these escarpments, as swallows performed aerobatics over the insect-rich waters. The Life Mounds called to mind the landscapes of ancient standing stones and barrows, of south-east Asian rice terraces, of patterns seen through a microscope; there was something of the spiralling forms of far-flung galaxies. All of these things (perhaps not the rice terraces) are acknowledged influences. Over the decades – he is a notably young 70 – Jencks has written a number of spirited books on modern architecture. It was his Modern Movements in Architecture, published in 1973, which helped me see that what had passed for a monolithic, single-minded Modern Movement had been no such thing. It was Jencks who identified the shift away from the certainties of modernism into the vagaries and rich (and sometimes indigestible) experiences of postmodernism: The Language of Postmodern Architecture, written 30 years ago by Jencks, remains a bestseller. And it is Jencks who, I can't help feeling, has begun to tire of the intellectual thinness of much contemporary ""iconic"" architecture, and to look for something beyond its ephemeral nature.

""Have I turned away from architecture? No, it's not that,"" he says when we meet at Portrack House, his home near Dumfries. ""But I do believe architecture, and all art, should be content-driven. It should have something to say beyond the sensational. But, yes, the lack of culture in so much new architecture is worrying."" Jencks wants to shape works that make us stop and think about our place, not just in the here and now, but in the cosmos. ""It's something people have done even before they built Stonehenge, so why not now?""

The biggest woman in the world

Over the past decade and beyond, Jencks has fused a hungry interest in cosmology with his love and encyclopaedic knowledge of architecture and landscape art. This vision is explained in a new and engaging book, The Universe in the Landscape. ""Not everyone will get it,"" he writes, with touching honesty. The Life Mounds at Bonnington are informed by cosmic patterns, as well as the molecular structure of cells at the point where, for good or carcinogenic ill, they divide. This stunning landform turns out to be a meditation on life and death.

""I've been a lucky man,"" Jencks says. ""I've only faced one real tragedy: the death of my wife, Maggie, from cancer in 1995."" Maggie Jencks was an innovative garden designer; together, throughout the 80s and 90s, the couple created their Garden of Cosmic Speculation in the grounds of Portrack House. Maggie's Centres, a number of cancer care clinics designed by world-famous architects (Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Richard Rogers) were her idea, and is a scheme that has continued in her honour.

Jencks is now working on an enormous project just north of Newcastle. He has been commissioned by a UK coal-mining company to create a land form that will soften and enhance an otherwise challenging landscape. ""Northumberlandia"" (the name is his, intended to suggest a land goddess) is currently under construction, and due for completion in 2013. A giant effigy, in clay and soil, of a recumbent naked woman rising 34 metres (her breasts) and measuring 400 metres from head to toe, she will, Jencks says, be ""the world's largest human form sculpted into the landscape"".

Such figurative interpretations of earth goddesses could be seen as kitsch. But Jencks argues that she will fold, if not quite blur, into the landscape. Still, compared with the layers of cosmological meaning embedded into Portrack and Bonnington, this is clearly a populist work, one its patrons hope will become a major tourist attraction.

The Gretna Landmark Project should be one, too. Details have yet to be unveiled, but this ambitious work will mark one of the key border crossings between Scotland and England. Developed by Jencks and the artist Andy Goldsworthy, the final design will also involve the disparate talents of designer and engineer Cecil Balmond, California artist Ned Kahn and British architect Chris Wilkinson. Expect the unexpected, and certainly the bold and eye-catching.

Meanwhile, Jencks and his 30-year-old daughter, Lily, an architect and landscape designer, have been working on a design for CERN (the European Organisation for Nuclear Research) near Geneva. Their brief is to give this hidden wonder of the modern world (its workings are mostly underground) a physical presence. ""There is no question,"" says Jencks, ""that this Vatican of Science, with the visage of Heathrow Airport, desperately needs urban definition."" As far as I can make out, the end result will be a pair of giant interlocking question marks made of grassed earth closing around, and interrogating The Globe – a hollow timber sphere originally designed for the 2002 Swiss Expo by architect Hervé Dessimoz.

In Jencks's view, cosmic passion, or the desire to know and relate to the universe, is one of the strongest drives in sentient creatures. The power of neolithic henges and bronze-age barrows, of the Uffington White Horse and some of the greatest buildings of all time – the spiral minaret at Samarra in Iraq, the Pantheon in Rome – lies in their elemental qualities. Their meanings are not explicit, yet they send shivers of recognition down the spine. The Life Mounds at Bonnington, to my mind Jencks's best landform work to date, have that effect on me.",His swirling 'land sculptures' are inspired by molecular biology and outer space.

Traditionalists will recoil at a 10-story cube wrapped in silvery rows of teardrop-shaped aluminum blades lined up so that the rows are solid from some perspectives and see-through from others. San Franciscans who loathe private automobiles will question why another parking garage should even exist.

But there's kinetic beauty in a structure that's designed to be glimpsed on the move, or out of the corner of your eye, and to shift in tone the next time you look. It taps into a basic truth - that smart buildings fuse the reality of what they do with the potential of where they are.

Here, the location is a site on the 16th Street traffic corridor across from the backside of UCSF-Mission Bay. Interstate 280's ramps cut by on the west. The east side of the block contains the 289-bed UCSF Mission Bay Medical Center, which opens in 2015 and so far is another institutional-looking piece of Mission Bay, complete with beige walls of precast concrete.

While the parking garage exists to serve the hospital, they look nothing alike. Instead, the architects at WRNS Studio treated the garage as a self-contained presence on the evolving urban landscape.

The garage begins with an open ground floor beneath a layer of perforated white aluminum. From there on up, the cladding stacks eight rows of panels 10 feet high that contain blades in a dusky tone dubbed Champagne bronze.

All the blades on a given panel line up the same way, but there are five distinct alignment patterns ranging from straight-out to all-but-shut. As a vertical counterpoint, taller fins of white aluminum occasionally break the rhythm of horizontal steel.

Assemble the varied panels in seemingly random procession and it's as though energy is rippling in place. Drive north on I-280 and the walls seem to fan open as you pass; the walk along 16th reveals a mosaic with sections that glow or fade as clouds pass and the sun heads west.

""We could have set all the blades at a certain angle, but then there would be angles from which you could see inside the whole time,"" said Kyle Elliot of WRNS, who led the design effort. ""We wanted a layered sense of translucency where the dynamics are always changing.""

What makes this more than a gimmick is the care with which the pieces have been arranged, and the attention paid to how people might encounter the whole.

Viewed by an observer on foot, the garage is as inviting as a stand-alone garage can be: The circulation areas have walls of rich white ceramic tile, while the corners where elevators are located are skinned in such a way that users can easily see their destination, the hospital to the east.

As for the skin, it is deep and dense enough to look like something more than a veil across a concrete hulk.

Give the credit to WRNS, which has made a specialty of site-appropriate garages. This is the firm's second in Mission Bay. The first, at 450 South St., has walls of angled white stucco that play up the contrast between shadows and light. It is meant to be viewed all at once, as though it were a billboard-sized canvas; the newcomer eventually will sit behind other buildings on the block, so the fragmented tone makes sense.

These days, garages have a certain cachet in the world of prestige architecture. One of the most talked-about buildings of 2010 was a Miami garage by Herzog & de Meuron, known here as designers of the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum. The Florida city is also in line for a garage by Zaha Hadid, who not only won the 2004 Pritzker Architecture Prize but has been proclaimed ""the Lady Gaga of Architecture"" by Glamour magazine.

The difference in San Francisco is that the medical center garage isn't meant to dazzle outsiders. It was done on a design-build basis by WRNS and the construction firm Rudolph and Sletten on a $15.75 million budget. It exists mainly for the use of families visiting their children, as worthy a role as a parking garage can play.

But a garage, or any other sizable structure, also has a role to play in the larger city. And when you see this one rise to the challenge, you wonder why other buildings in this part of Mission Bay can't strike a wide positive note as well.

When I was a kid I traveled all over the western United States camping and fishing. Then I went to architecture school, became obsessed and dropped the fishing for 30 years. I have an architecture firm in California where we do urban public schools. As that generated more and more stress, I sort of realized I had to do something other than architecture. I have friends who don't do anything but work, and I saw that as unhealthy. So I started fishing again.

I settled on this place for a lot of reasons. I grew up in Laguna Beach, Calif. I used to spend a lot of time on probably one and a half miles of coastline, and ended up knowing it like the back of my hand. I was looking for a place that I could know that way. A place that would be dynamic and changing.

Most rivers in the western United States are dammed, which sort of tames them. The Yellowstone River isn't dammed and it is always a little different every time you come here.

I knew I wanted to build a small house. That is kind of a general philosophy of mine. I'd rather build a good house than a big house, because that allows you to do what you want and use the stuff that you want.

I got rough-hewn beams of Douglas fir and used them like logs. The outside of the house is largely unfinished. I put one layer of bleaching stain on it. I want it to gray out and rot, but at a slower pace than I do. My house has a terrific view facing north toward a really nice valley with lots of mountains. The whole house revolves around a very large window that looks out to this view. Interview by Brennan Kearney

The Boston-based home, auto, and workers’ compensation insurance company is putting its 10 St. James Ave. and 75 Arlington St. buildings up for sale.

The company moved many of its employees from those buildings to the new $300 million tower it built with public aid at 157 Berkeley St. in 2013. The state and the City of Boston kicked in more than $46 million worth of tax credits and property tax breaks for the building, after Liberty promised to add jobs and expand its investment locally.

After the new building opened, Liberty only needed about 40 percent of the 825,000 square feet in the James Avenue and Arlington Street buildings and rents out the remaining space, the company said.

The sale should have no effect on the company’s employees or its investment in the city, said David Long, Liberty Mutual’s chief executive officer. After the sale, Liberty Mutual will continue to lease space in the James Avenue and Arlington Street buildings.

The older buildings became investment rental property and the company wanted to focus on its core insurance business, said John Cusolito, a spokesman for Liberty Mutual.

“Those two buildings have become predominately rental space. That’s not a business we’re in,” Cusolito said. “It’s a good time to sell.”

Liberty is selling at one of the hottest periods for Boston commercial real estate.

Top-tier office buildings in the Back Bay and the Financial District have fetched previously unheard of sums, as international investors looking for stable, long-term assets, buy in Boston. A year ago, the real estate arm of a Canadian pension fund paid $1.3 billion for 500 Boylston and 222 Berkeley streets, just around the corner from Liberty’s buildings. At about $1,000 a square foot, that price set the record for large Boston office buildings, a record that was matched in April when a German investment fund bought a new office building in the Seaport for a comparable amount.

Liberty’s building may not sell for quite that rich of a sum, said Rob Griffin, who leads the Boston office of real estate firm Newmark Knight Grubb Frank and is handling the sale for the insurance company.

He expects the sale price to come in at around $650 million, which equates to about $800 per square foot.

Still, with 96 percent occupancy and $30 million in recent rehabs, he expects interest in the building to be strong.

“We think there’s going to be a tremendous appetite for these buildings from international buyers, and from domestic buyers” who’ve been crowded out of the market, he said.

Liberty is selling the buildings as its profits have faltered. In the first half of this year, Liberty Mutual’s profits were down by one-quarter to $408 million, compared with $530 million during the same time in 2015.

Cusolito said the decision to sell is unrelated to the company’s earnings results.

After the sale, Liberty Mutual will still own more than 1 million square feet of space in three other downtown buildings, including at 157 Berkeley St., 175 Berkeley St., and 30 St. James Ave. The company has 4,400 employees spread among its Boston buildings.",Liberty Mutual Insurance will shrink its building footprint in Boston and announced Tuesday that it plans to sell two office towers in the Back Bay.,24.7692307692,0.8846153846,2.9615384615,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

Alton library. Photograph: David Levene

Tucked within some of the least spoiled countryside in Hampshire, Alton is a town of two halves. On the one hand, it remains a traditional English market town, complete with an ancient parish church, three independent butchers, a brewery, a toyshop, a weekly market and a local museum. On the other, its Georgian high street was brutally assaulted in the 1960s and 1970s by a wave of witless concrete design, and is now packed with aggressive traffic.

So when local and county councils agreed that Alton needed a new public library, the question of style might well have been a thorny one. Should the new design be a government-approved ""icon"" complete with enigmatic roof and cosmogenic interior? Or should it be designed in a safe, dreary ""planning permission vernacular"" style - as seen in the unimaginative forms of the new community centres, local clinics and ring-road supermarkets dulling down the rural landscape?

The finished library, which cost £1.25m, is neither a compromise between old and new, nor a parody of local styles. Seen from the top of Vicarage Hill - the winding street that leads down to the new building from the railway station - it is a fine, unexpected design, whose steep pitched roof and slit-like upper floor windows catch the eye, without looking out of place in these Georgian and Victorian surroundings.

""Alton is a market town with a rural heritage,"" says Martin Hallum, project architect of the new library. ""We knew we had to talk to as many people as possible, to address their fears while raising their hopes. The old library was housed in a former Civil Defence tin and concrete hut. We could only aspire upwards, but, as architects, we needed to get as many people on our side as possible.

""Perhaps I might have liked to have designed a more obviously modern building at one stage, but as we pushed on with the project, I began to see how we might give shape to a building that could be modern without following fashion at the same time as being somehow traditional without being old-fashioned.""

And that is just what the new building achieves. It is like a handsome modern barn, neatly crafted from handmade red bricks and roof tiles (from a yard in nearby Romsey), and making robust use of oak joinery. The brickwork of the south front is punctured by huge windows, which bring daylight into the furthest recesses of the essentially open-plan interior. These are fronted by handmade oak sun louvres that look terrific. So does the simple timber bench on the pavement in front of them. Designed as a stopping place for passers-by wanting to soak up some sun, the bench has inevitably found an additional role as a launch-pad for skateboards. It is tough enough to cope.

The interior, arranged over three floors, is equally simple, unpretentious and efficiently modern. The ground floor is the lending library with a self-service cafe, and separate reading areas for children and teenagers. The first floor boasts a desk of computers, a reference library and a Jane Austen study in one big-windowed corner. Under the pitched roof, the librarians have their comfortable office.

The bookcases are handsome things assembled from varnished plywood. Chairs and tables are comfortable and the lighting throughout is excellent. Alton Library is not, thankfully, some whizzy new ""ideas store"": it is, quite simply, a great place to read and write. And it is a model of how to design and craft a functional new building in an old town suspicious of what modernising means: in Alton's case, junk, junk and junk again.

The heroes of the day are not free-thinking architects wanting to break away from the new tyranny of ""wow factor"" design, but Hampshire County Council's long-established architectural unit - one of the very last of England's once highly respected local authority architects' departments. Previously led by Colin Stansfield Smith (who won the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture in 1991) and now under the direction of Steve Clow, the department has continued to produce an exceptionally high standard of public design. Employing 57 architects, six landscape architects, six land surveyors, 10 interior designers and 15 clerks of works, the architecture unit is a quietly effective force to be reckoned with, aiming to increase its civilising influence on new developments throughout Hampshire.

I came to Alton not sure of what I would make of this building. Would it be altogether too modest to attract anyone's attention? I left, though, surprised and enchanted. Here is a building that takes on and develops local traditions, playing intelligently with the timeless forms of tithe barns and grain stores, stables and other rural industrial buildings. A strong and simple building, constructed from local materials, that follows its own logic and adds intelligently to the design of a market town that rightly fears ""wow factor"" architecture.",Alton's new library has enough traditional touches to make Jane Austen feel at home.

It was the building on which his architectural reputation is based, the project that made him famous, and which transformed the world's view not just of Sydney, but of Australia too. But he left the country in 1966, nine years after winning the competition to build what turned out to be one of just a handful of genuinely iconic works of 20th-century architecture, when the opera house's superstructure was beginning to take shape. He never went back.

He had been driven to resign from the project after a series of bitter rows with local politicians, not primarily about money, though this was an issue. The politicians were accused of deliberately underestimating costs to get the project started. Ultimately, the row was about power: creatively, was this going to be an architect's building, or was it going to be a monument to an obscure New South Wales minister for public works?

There were real technical issues at stake. In an era before desktop computing had transformed the limits of structural engineering, Utzon was asking for a lot in trying to get his complex shells built in load-bearing concrete, while accommodating all that the brief called for. He began the project working with the great engineer Ove Arup. The relationship between the two Danes, warm at first, turned sour. After Arup's death, the English critic Peter Murray was given access to his private papers. They suggest that Arup repeatedly offered Utzon workable technical solutions, but because they did not reflect the purity of the architect's vision, they were ignored. For a particularly troubled period, Utzon failed even to respond to Arup and seemed unable to offer a clear way ahead. The fact that Arup refused to walk away from the project when Utzon resigned triggered a bitter and lasting break between them.

Utzon lost the political game, and was finessed into resigning without ever fully understanding that he was taking an irrevocable step. He thought his resignation was a threat he would never be expected to have to act on. Utzon left Australia permanently, and was replaced by a panel of local architects who went on to complete the building - one of whom had actually signed a petition that circulated in the New South Wales government architect's office refusing to work on the project if Utzon went.

For an architect there can be no fate worse than seeing a project that should have been the crowning achievement of his career taken away from him by what he saw as a cabal of uncomprehending philistines. It was not a question of cost overruns that allowed the politicians to oust Utzon. The worst of these came long after Utzon had left Australia. What did for him in the end was a change of party in the New South Wales state government that coincided with disagreements - ostensibly about the cost and character of the proposed plywood-beamed interior - fought out in the claustrophobically small world of Sydney government. And it left Utzon humiliatingly out of pocket, the victim of a punitive double taxation regime that saw him paying over almost all his earnings to a combination of the Australian and the Danish tax authorities.

Thereafter, Utzon maintained a dignified silence about his treatment by Sydney. When the Queen opened the Opera House in 1973, Utzon was invited, but was unavoidably elsewhere. When the Royal Australian Institute of Architects awarded him its gold medal in 1973, Utzon accepted, but stayed away from the ceremony. When Utzon was asked to take part in designing a resort in Queensland, he agreed to take on the commission, but sent his two architect sons, Jan and Kim, to deal with the client instead. Sydney tried to make amends by awarding him the freedom of the city in 1998, but the lord mayor had to take the keys to Denmark to present them. For the building's 25th birthday that year, Utzon's daughter, Lin, went to Sydney and joined the state premier in launching the Utzon Foundation, a trust to award a £37,000 biennial prize for outstanding achievement in the arts - but Utzon did not attend.

As he told the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1978, when he was awarded the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture, an honour he did collect in person: ""If you like an architect's work, you give him something to build, not a medal.""

When Utzon was in his 80s, there was something of a reconciliation with Australia. A decision was taken to remodel the interiors of the Opera House much in the manner that Utzon had intended in an attempt to deal with the acoustic problems and the difficulties caused by a lack of space behind the scenes; Jan took part in the planning process. It was not an easy task, and recently Utzon's grandson Jeppe, also an architect, has questioned whether it is possible at this stage to fully realise the original vision.

Utzon did ultimately manage to survive the trauma of Sydney. There were other buildings, at least two of which - the Bagsværd church in Denmark (1968-76), and the Kuwait National Assembly (designed from 1971 onwards, completed 1983 and rebuilt 1993) - must be counted masterpieces. Both of them, like Sydney, seemed to stand outside the mainstream of 20th-century modernism. All three have a sculptural purity that makes them compelling works of architecture.

The house that Utzon built himself in Mallorca overlooking the sea, in which he spent many years, was a domestically scaled summation of Utzon's architectural ideas. Yet, for an architect of Utzon's special talent, it was a modest output for such a long career. And the Kuwait building, like Sydney, was fatally compromised. It was the unloved child of a shortlived opening towards democratic government in Kuwait, abandoned by the ruling family, shelled by the Iraqis, and restored by the American architects HOK after the Gulf war.

Could it have been any different? On one level, there is a temptation to think that had the Opera House gone more smoothly, then it could have opened the way to a career that might even have matched that of one of the 20th-century's acknowledged architectural giants - Louis Kahn, perhaps, or even Le Corbusier. In 2003, Utzon was presented with the Pritzker prize, a tribute from a jury that included Frank Gehry.

Born in Copenhagen, Utzon studied architecture at the city's Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After the second world war, he joined the Helsinki office of the great Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, a champion of non-standard building types and curves, and won travelling scholarships to Morocco and the US; he also designed furniture and glassware.

If Utzon had managed a sustained run of work exploring the themes that underpinned his work, he could genuinely have transformed the architectural landscape. But he didn't, and perhaps he never could have done. Utzon was profoundly out of sympathy with the idea that architecture could be practised as a corporate business, taking on multiple projects around the world. When Utzon won the Opera House competition, he turned down an offer to design an art gallery just outside Copenhagen at Louisiana. It would have been the perfect commission, yet Utzon did not want to risk losing focus on the Opera House.

There was something in Utzon's psychological make-up that meant he found the idea of professional success too difficult to get to grips with. Certainly, Utzon's personal architectural language was a curious mix of influences and sources: the sweeping curves of the yachts that his father designed; Mexico's man-made landscapes, such as Monte Alban and the great pre-Columbian sites; the medieval castles of Denmark; and the work of the European masters.

But Sydney Opera House is a truly singular building, one that changed Utzon's life and probably the course of Australian history as well. The competition to design it was launched in 1956, the year that Melbourne, Sydney's great rival, was hosting the Olympics, at a time when Melbourne was still the central focus of urban Australia. Melbourne was bigger, more famous, richer and more successful than its northern rival.

The Opera House, financed by a specially constituted state lottery, managed to change all that. It was the landmark that marked the start of a huge turn-

around in the perceptions of Australia in general and Sydney in particular. It was the project, more than any other, that allowed Australia to ditch the ""cultural cringe"". Architecturally, that cringe is monumentalised in the recently completed National Museum of Australia in Canberra, where in a sly architectural reference to Sydney the designers incorporate a fragment of the Opera House in the entrance hall. According to the museum's architect: ""It's not the bit by Utzon, it's a fragment of the glass curtain that was designed after he had gone, to show how wrong Australia can get things.""

The Opera House was the building that made Sydney Harbour move from a tangle of industrial sites to become one of the greatest waterfronts in the world; by the time of the next Olympics to be hosted by Australia, 44 years later, the opera house was a familiar but still striking image in the television coverage broadcast round the world from Sydney. And it was Utzon who made it possible. There had been nothing quite like the Opera House design before.

Even though, 10 years earlier, Utzon had entered a competition in London to design a replacement for the Crystal Palace, which he did not win, his submission did show that he had offered London the chance to build something just as extraordinary as the opera house. It was personal, sculptural and apparently quite outside the mainstream of architectural development at the time.

The only work that seemed to relate to it was the soaring sweeping concrete roofs designed by Eero Saarinen, one of the judges for the Opera House competition. Saarinen adopted a similar approach for the TWA terminal at New York's Kennedy airport. It belonged to an alternative pattern of modernity. And had Utzon had a different temperament, it might have been so much more than a historical one-off.

He married Lis Fenger in 1942: she and their children Jan, Kim and Lin survive him.

http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/23/architecture.art,http://web.archive.org/web/20151221234715id_/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/23/architecture.art,Jonathan Glancey visits the oasis that is Anish Kapoor's home,1970-08-22 05:33:41.234715,"Looking for the artist Anish Kapoor's new house in Chelsea, London, I decide he might be having a Turner moment. I was expecting a beautifully crafted modern house, with walls of glass, stone and shimmering stainless steel, designed by the architect Tony Fretton. What I didn't know was that all of this would be secreted behind a bland slab of speculative neo-Georgian design.

The painter JMW Turner set up home in Chelsea more than 150 years ago, when it was a poor and unfashionable suburb - but one where wonderful light was cast every day over the Thames. The Indian-born Kapoor belongs to a very different generation of British artist, one that thrives on celebrity. In moving to Chelsea, he has chosen to make his family home in what is now one of the most expensive and least bohemian parts of London.

Kapoor and his wife Susanna's Notting Hill home was designed by an architect friend, Pip Horne, in the late 1980s, so the idea of building a new house was not in itself a challenge. What was new was the idea of a modern house hidden from the street - ""as you might find in Paris or Barcelona,"" Kapoor explains. A passage below the neo-Geo flats leads you into a world of unexpected courtyards, gardens and trees. There are enormous rooms, sudden stairs, cleverly constructed views and a richness of low-key materials. The narrow entrance gives way to a star-shaped courtyard, open to the sky. The kitchen and dining room are at one end of this courtyard; the other is faced, down a few wide steps, by a long living room. This is as much a private art gallery as a space in which to relax or entertain.

""The idea of the courtyards was a given, really,"" says Kapoor. ""This is a long, narrow site and we wanted to get as much daylight into the rooms as possible. The idea developed so that the house became a way of walking in and out of fresh air and gardens, on the way from one side to the other.""

Kapoor has collaborated with a number of architects over the years; a series of striking curved and mirror-finished entrances for subway stations in Naples, which he developed with Future Systems, will open later this year. His most radical work on an architectural, and indeed monumental, scale has been in partnership with the structural engineer Cecil Balmond. Their Marsyas sculpture, installed in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in 2002, was an extraordinary stretch of voluptuous red fabric. Next year, another Balmond-Kapoor project will transform the Middlesbrough landscape: Tenemos, a kind of voluminous windsock stretched between apparently delicate posts, is the first of a series of five vast public artworks, with sites in Stockton, Redcar, Hartlepool and Darlington next in line. ""All these projects,"" Kapoor says, ""are about interrogating form, and making large-scale objects that manage to be as ethereal as they are substantial.""

Where Kapoor's sculptures are often richly coloured and sensuously formed, his new home works around a limited palette. At first glance, it is as cool as a cucumber. ""I am naturally playful,"" Kapoor agrees, ""while Tony [Fretton], though he has a dry sense of humour, can be almost comically dour."" The principal rooms have been designed for books and artworks. These, and family life (the Kapoors have two children), will provide all the colour needed. Fretton has worked with Hopton Wood limestone and Mandale Fossil stone, two materials much loved by British sculptors and architects since the 1930s. Hopton Wood limestone, quarried near Matlock, Derbyshire, is creamy, warm and studded with fossils; Mandale Fossil limestone, from a quarry close by, comes in shades of grey and is immensely hard-wearing.

Kapoor and Fretton have known each other for years, since the artist's work was first shown in the Fretton-designed Lisson Gallery, in London. ""We've enjoyed a healthily detached relationship,"" says Kapoor. ""As a client, you need some sense of distance from your architect. I thought of keeping out of the way while he built the house - he's a craftsman by nature and very involved in construction - but I couldn't help myself, and ended up coming down nearly every morning on my way to my studio in Camberwell.""

Kapoor doesn't intend to work from home. ""The house is a quiet object,"" he says. ""This is a family home, not a place for me to make a mess - I have a studio for that. For me, architecture is about the essentials of light, space, proportion and materials. I don't want to live in a sculpture designed by an architect. I go crazy when I hear people say that the best new sculpture is by architects - meaning overexpressive buildings. I love making sculptures, and collaborating with architects, but I want to live in a house that's a happy home, not an artwork.""

Kapoor says that if he could have chosen any architect in recent history to build him a house, he would have chosen Louis Kahn. ""No disrespect to Tony. Kahn is long dead, and anyway, I'm not sure I would be able to live up to one of his designs. He made everyday buildings somehow mythic, and my family and I need a healthy dose of reality to make everyday life comfortable. Tony and I also share a huge admiration for the work of [American conceptual artist] Dan Graham, and this house is partly a homage to him. We'll be installing a Graham pavilion in the garden courtyard here, so house and artwork will play off one another.""

Fretton has designed homes and studios for artists throughout his career. From the Lisson Gallery in Marylebone, through the Camden Arts Centre (in 2004), via modest and beautiful spaces including the Holton Lee Studios on the Dorset coast, Fretton's subtle designs have been handmaidens to modern British art. Each is quietly powerful; none gets in the way. Kapoor describes his own home as ""a reflection of a quiet modern vernacular"". ""It has traditional rooms, even if some are pretty big. And, look, we've even got skirting boards! They're made of strips of stainless steel rather than traditional timber, but which modern architect would put skirting boards in a new house? They hate them.""

In a sense, Fretton and Kapoor are following in a tradition of creating just such houses in Chelsea - artists' homes that play a subtle game of balancing new and age-old designs, plans and building materials. In the late 19th century, artists such as William Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Singer Sargent came to live and work in Chelsea. A generation of radical artists and architects (Richard Norman Shaw, CR Ashbee) teamed up to shape the look of the area. The 1921 census reveals that nine out of every 1,000 people living in Chelsea was an artist. Today, the borough has become so expensive that the Chelsea College of Art and Design has left, moving to Westminster.

Will the artists return here? If they make Hirst-loads of money, perhaps. In the meantime, Kapoor's secret hideaway, a brushstroke or two away from Turner's old house, is a fitting retreat for a contemporary artist quietly in love with the best - but not the noisiest - modern architecture.","A passageway through a nondescript block of flats leads Jonathan Glancey to the artist Anish Kapoor's new home: a quiet oasis filled with sculpture, light and green spaces",47.0,0.7419354839000001,1.6451612903,high,low,mixed,architecture

In a case that contractors warned could result in higher prices for the construction of public buildings, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled Wednesday that Gilbane wasn’t wholly responsible for an error in the hospital’s plans that allegedly caused at least $5 million in extra costs. The case was sent back to a lower court for further arguments.

Gilbane was the construction-manager-at-risk on the project, a role that gave it some influence in the design process. Many public works projects are designed by architects before construction firms bid on the job, but Massachusetts and local authorities have increasingly turned to construction-managers-at-risk to cut down on time-consuming blueprint modifications and disputes.

Since 2005, local authorities have commissioned more than $5.3 billion in public works that rely on the construction-manager-at-risk method, according to the state inspector general’s office. State agencies have commissioned untold amounts more.

The method can’t legally be used for some projects, such as the Green Line Extension, according to a MassDOT presentation. But David Hatem, an attorney who frequently represents designers on public works projects and filed a brief in the case, said the ruling addressed similar questions of who bears the risks of big construction projects — contractors or taxpayers.

“You’re dealing with the same legal issues,” Hatem said. “I think it’s an extraordinarily thoughtful decision. It’s well-balanced.”

Trade bodies representing architects and engineers argued the Supreme Judicial Court should rule against Gilbane, saying the law was written so the builder would bear the risk of cost overruns. A group of general contractors asked the court to rule otherwise, and warned that a negative outcome would require construction managers to charge more for public projects, raising costs for taxpayers to offset that risk.

John W. DiNicola II, a partner at DiNicola Seligson & Upton who represented Gilbane and its insurer in the appeal, said the court “accepted basically all of our arguments.” The state’s Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance said it viewed the outcome as nothing more than a procedural move, however.

“DCAMM is confident that it will prevail at trial,” said Brendan Moss, a spokesman for the division.

Between then and now, the delightful Walking House, a 3.5 metre diameter hexagon of black steel tube, 3.5 metres long, will be going through its paces. What it does, as its name suggests is to walk, if only very slowly, at just 0.1mph in fact. Have a look above on YouTube to see it in action.

Six electrically powered lunar module-like legs with bright yellow pads, or feet, enable the house to go walkabout. Designed by the Copenhagen artists' collective N55, Walking House is an essentially romantic idea lovingly realised using new, environmentally friendly technology. The inspiration for the design was the Romany travellers' traditional way of life, roaming the country, and across borders, by caravan, but brought up to date: Walking House has no need for horses and reins or diesel engines, gearboxes and wheels to make it go. While standing still, it generates power through solar cells and small windmills and when fully charged it gets up and walks.

The NASA-style prototype has been designed for four people, although the members of N55's Walking House team – Ion Sorvin, Oivind Alexander Slaatto and Sam Kronick – are keen to point out that its structure can be extended, while if stacked together, a group of Walking Houses could form temporary villages. The prototype features polycarbonate windows, built-in furniture, including sleeping platforms, a composting lavatory and a wood-burning stove.

The idea is not entirely new, as the British Pop architectural collective, Archigram, designed a Walking City, largely attributed to the late Ron Herron, in 1964 and there have been any number of walking pods and other inhabitable structures in sci-fi novels, comic strips and films over the past century. Realised in the form of drawings and animation, Herron's Walking City was a hugely enjoyable proposal, an entire city that could get up, walk to wherever in the world its citizens would like to go, and plug itself into the local landscape for energy and supplies. The city could take itself on holiday, and Herron's beautifully realised drawings showed this giant automaton taking itself on trips to various exotic locations.

The thinking behind Walking House is compelling: why can't we live more like Travellers have? Why do we need to stick to one place? There are many answers to these questions, of course, but questions of culture, work, how and where we educate our children aside, the all too real answer is property. Or land. In most of the world, humans have parcelled up and privatised land and its ownership is seen as an almost God-given right. And, this is why Travellers themselves have found the modern world an increasingly hostile place. Wherever they go, the customs and rules of land ownership say ""you're not welcome here"".

So, while Walking House is a special project, it might be hard for potential future owners to find anywhere to walk their house to, except a caravan site. And can you imagine Walking Houses cluttering up roads on Bank Holidays as they plod along at the speed of a singularly dozy tortoise in the wake of caravans towed by cars? They wouldn't be very popular.

The nomadic way of life, although much romanticised, has largely died out worldwide. This might be sad, yet Walking House shows that the idea is far from dead, and that the notion of ambling through the world in the equivalent of a gaily painted Gypsy caravan might just be brought happily bang up to date.","The Walking House recalls ancient nomadic habits, but is it a practical answer to lower carbon living, asks Jonathan Glancey",32.0454545455,0.5454545455,0.7272727273,medium,low,abstractive,architecture

Its incredibly strong design was borne of lack of land and brilliant leadership. Because the site was small, the architects lifted the auditorium above the foyer. The effect was to make the building transparent in all four directions, so it became a truly public meeting space. It also handles its setting brilliantly. As originally conceived, before the reorientation of the building in the 1960s, visitors entered from two directions: the north (from the Thames) at a high level, and the south at a low level. The routes in met at the fulcrum of the plan - and when you got there, the route to the stairs, and thus to your seat, was completely legible. These side entrances were utterly lacking in pomposity. Another reason I love the Festival Hall is the way it is made. It is one of the last complete examples of a building with constituent parts made especially for it, from architecture and stage design to textile, seats and even doorhandles. This was a playful modernism that was not spare or lean but vibrant and tactile. It is the fruit of an incredibly skilled team of designers, a very complete piece of thinking.

Whereas the Festival Hall is a civic building and warrants its prominence on the Thames, ordinary office buildings that make pompous claims for themselves, and do it in an ugly way, are worse than buildings that are simply insignificant. Such is the case with Riverside House by RHWL Architects, along the Thames near Blackfriars Bridge. It breaks the line of buildings that runs along the bank with a curved section pointing out towards the water. It has all the architectural quality of a puffed-up turkey, and all the cultural content of a turkey's head.

It was the offspring of a white bull given as a gift by Poseidon, god of the sea, to Minos, and the king's wife, Queen Pasiphae. Enraged, not to say embarrassed, by his wife's passion for a bull, Minos hid the Minotaur in the fiendish underground Labyrinth designed by Daedalus, the Athenian inventor.

Each year, Minos would send seven young Greek men and seven young Greek women into the Labyrinth. Hopelessly lost, they would eventually meet the fiendish Minotaur who made a gruesome meal of them.

One fine day, Theseus arrived, armed with a sword given him by Minos's daughter, Ariadne, who had fallen instantly in love with him. The young Greek disappeared into the Labyrinth, slew the Minotaur and returned safely with the help of the famous ball of golden string given to him by Ariadne.

Last month, the Minotaur labyrinth opened in the grounds of Kielder Castle in Northumberland. Designed by architect Nick Coombe and artist Shona Kitchen, the £125,000 maze is a fine object. A handsome architectural sculpture, it is also a giant game for anyone to play, free of charge, at any time of any day of the year. Built of basalt stones that turn from shining silver grey in the dry to gleaming near black in the wet, caged in thick steel-wire mesh, the Minotaur labyrinth is a perfect match for its forest setting.

It is also a welcome addition to other architecturally inspired artworks built elsewhere in the Kielder Forest Park by the Kielder Partnership. These include James Turrell's magical Skyspace - a circular chamber of ever-changing, challenging and intensely focused, natural and artificial light - and the Belvedere, by Softroom, a mirror-surfaced refuge that distorts reflections of nature and weather, and draws you towards it, like some oddly bright black hole.

Summer or winter, the place is a delight. Whether or not a labyrinth should be delightful is another question. The Minotaur labyrinth is certainly a determinedly serious-looking structure, yet it is animated by the shrieks and laughter of children thrilling to its sudden twists, turns and seeming blind alleys. One of these leads to a stone stair. From its top, visitors get an aerial view of the structure and can try to work out how to get to its secret, glass-lined centre. On the way round the labyrinth, there are slits in the walls, 26 of them, through which you can see and hear others worming their stringless way through this gloriously physical and computerless game. There are alcoves to spring surprises on trailing parents and a constant play of shadows as the sun, or moon, races overhead through the watery Northumberland cloudscape.

There is a total of 200 metres of wall, two metres high, contained within the labyrinth's 22 metre by 18 metre plan. These are made of 480 tons of basalt stone and 10 tons of shimmering recycled glass. You can imagine an entire building being constructed this way; it would be very beautiful.

The original Labyrinth was neither playful nor beautiful; it was a terrible and dark instrument of slow and cruel death. Of course, it was a myth. But architects cannot help being fascinated by this story. Since no one has been able to find Daedalus's mythical labyrinth, most archaeologists and historians tend to agree that the labyrinth was the palace of Knossos itself. And the Minotaur? Perhaps he was King Minos, assuming he existed. We know little of the Minoans. What we do know, though, is that they were highly effective and respected traders at the time of the construction of the palace you can see on Crete today. The Minoans swept their part of the Mediterranean clean of pirates. They were wealthy. They worshipped bulls. They built a great palace that was probably also a temple of sorts. Their power was finally undermined by a powerful earthquake that ravaged the region in about 1450BC. Later, Minos, the Minoans and the Minotaur developed as a part of the Greeks' rich mythology.

Unlike the Greeks, the Minoans built asymmetrically in an ad hoc manner. So the great palace of Knossos, with its hundreds of rooms added to willy-nilly over many years, would have seemed irrational and even disturbing to visiting Athenians, especially as many of the rooms were built half-underground to keep them cool. These darkened spaces buried deep in the maze of corridors zig-zagging their way through the palace would have seemed pretty spooky.

Three and half thousand years later, the labyrinth represents, in part, the irrational side of architecture. Western architects have been trained since Greece to design rationally. The chance to design a labyrinth must have been a wonderful release. Even so, as Coombe and Kitchen's design proves, a modern labyrinth, confined into a specific space, needs to be carefully planned. Planned, though, in something like the way roller-coaster designers ply their scream-making craft. The engineering has to be rational, but the design must incorporate thrills and spills.

The Minotaur labyrinth is different in spirit from the many mazes ornamenting and animating gardens throughout Britain. Most of these are made from bushes. They are abstracted walks in the forest, echoing ancient memories of getting lost in an island that was once, before the rise of the great monasteries, covered in forest to a degree that is unimaginable today. The stone labyrinth, in contrast, recalls the dark, mythical world of a distant Mediterranean culture and the story of the terrifying Minotaur.

Labyrinths have been created in one form or another for thousands of years and in many cultures. Throughout pagan Europe, they were known as Troy Town or the Walls of Troy, a symbol of an ancient and fallen centre of the world of the old gods. Medieval Christian labyrinths, although designed in complex whirls, offered only one passage through, with no dead ends, to their centre. This symbolised the long and winding, but true path to the heart of God.

Prehistoric labyrinths can be found carved into rockfaces at Pontevedra in Galicia and Val Camonica in northern Italy, while a Bronze Age example, elsewhere in Italy, depicts a pair of eyes staring out from its centre. A graffito on a petrified house in Pompeii depicts a labyrinth; it is accompanied by the inscription labyrinthus hic habitat minotaurus (the labyrinth: the minotaur lives here), which, I suppose, was one up on the more usual cave canem (beware of the dog).

In Finland, Lapp hunters would walk labyrinths to trap the trolls and demons who would follow them inside, as trolls and demons will. A decorative labyrinth in the floor of Chartres cathedral is a representation of the passage leading to the mystery of God. Labyrinths are ancient, fascinating and, it seems, universal devices. In building a new one in the Kielder Forest, Coombes, Kitchen and the Kielder Partnership are not just making some enjoyable architectural toy, after all, but leading us back to the dark and ancient hearts of old gods, myths, monsters and designs that have little to do with the rational buildings we have long come to expect. Outside the forest, that is.

But they appear to intent on keeping all the ground they’ve taken from the militant group for their own national project, endangering the larger cause of keeping these two battered nation-states in one piece, and raising the prospect of another war patiently waiting at the conclusion of the current one.

The recent run of victories in Syria illustrates the Kurds’ battlefield capabilities. Six months after winning in Kobani, the Turkish border town where as many as 1,000 ISIS fighters died, Syrian Kurd fighters on June 15 took another border town, Tel Abyad, creating a corridor on Syria’s northern border and—far more important—cutting off the main supply line to Raqqah, ISIS’s capital 60 miles due south. On Tuesday, the Kurd forces—a Syrian affiliate of the Kurdistan Worker’s Party, or PKK—seized a military base known as Brigade 93, as well as the town adjoining it, Ain Issa. The victories put them within 30 miles of Raqqah.

The Kurds fight so well largely because, in addition to trying to defeat an extremist enemy, they’re fighting for something—a country of their own. The future Kurdistan may be severely buffeted across Arab portions of the Middle East—neither Yemen nor Libya have functioning central governments, and both Syria and Iraq exist largely as shards of sect, tribe and ethnicity. But the Kurds, despite their large numbers (about 30 million worldwide), as well as their shared language, culture and identity, have never had a nation. But they’re getting closer to one with every battle.

In Iraq, Kurdish forces armed by both Iran and the U.S. have taken perhaps 10,000 square miles from ISIS since last fall. They also snapped up the disputed city of Kirkuk, rich in oil and cultural significance to Kurds and Arabs alike—and are preventing Arabs from returning to some villages. Houses are marked “Reserved for Kurds,” and Kurdish checkpoints declare, “No Arabs Allowed.”

These acts on the ground are clearly intended to create “facts on the ground,” A political reality that Kurdish leaders will point as they navigate their relationship with the Iraqi central government in Baghdad, to which they are currently bound by oil-revenue contracts, if little else. As valiantly as the Kurds have fought, losing an estimated 1,000 men and women over the last year against ISIS, they see the conflict in terms of national liberation. Massoud Barzani, who leads the Kurdistan Regional Government, has repeatedly said Kurds will not fight for the rest of Iraq, or for the idea of it.

“Relying on Iraqi Kurds to act as coalition boots on the ground may eliminate some [ISIS] safe havens, but it is fueling Kurdish land grabs,” warns Denise Natali, a senior research fellow at National Defense University in Washington. “Iraqi Kurds are using U.S. airstrikes and the political vacuum in northern Iraq not only to push back ISIS, but also to recapture disputed territories and oil fields—some of the very measures that have fueled Sunni Arab resentment since 2003.”

Human Rights Watch documented instances of Kurds confining Sunni Arabs to specific areas to prevent their return, actions that Natali says undermine the attempts by the U.S. and Baghdad to lure Iraq’s Sunni Arabs away from the orbit of ISIS and back into Iraq’s national enterprise: “It’s all about addressing the Sunni Arabs’ grievances,” she tells TIME.

Iraq’s Kurds have tried this before, but more gently. After the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq removed Saddam Hussein, Kurds left the autonomous region that had been protected by U.S. warplanes for the previous decade, and moved into the northern Iraq city of Kirkuk—not with armor, which they don’t have, but with garbage trucks and street cleaners. The idea was to start providing essential government services to the oil-rich city, which is also claimed by Iraq’s Sunni population, and thereby assume control in the softest possible manner.

Kurdish leaders wanted everyone on their best behavior: They ordered looters to return 300 cars looted after the fall of the city, and fretted openly about acts of revenge, including rapes, being perpetrated against Arabs who had pushed them off their land.

It didn’t work. U.S. forces ordered the garbage trucks sent home, and for the next decade Iraq’s Kurds were forced to employ more gradual methods, mostly moving their people into the city, in order to win any referendum on its future. Then ISIS made its blitzkrieg, taking Iraq’s second-largest city of Mosul a year ago, then Tikrit and moving toward Kirkuk. But the Kurds got there first, and aim to hold on to it, and every other square mile they’ve won—including territory claimed by Arabs.

“We have to be careful that in our pushing back ISIS, we are not setting the stage for the next conflict,” says Natali. So far, the U.S. has had the leverage to hold the situation together, with help from Turkey, home to half the world’s Kurds. The maddening paradox is that the situation grows more difficult to manage with every gain against ISIS, the shared enemy.","They take town 30 miles from ISIS capital, but fight for a nation of their own",60.5294117647,0.9411764706,1.8823529412000002,high,medium,mixed,architecture

Rescue workers recovered 11 bodies and four badly injured people from the debris of the three-story buildings that fell in the city of Vadodara in Gujarat state, said fire chief Hitesh Taparia.

Most of the tenants in the first building, comprised of 14 apartments, were spleeping when the building collapsed. The adjacent building was evacuated just minutes before it came down, according to police officer Bhanu Pratap Parmar.

The buildings were part of 33 housing blocks constructed by the Gujarat government more than a decade ago to house the poor.

More than 250 rescue workers were working to clear debris from the site and search for survivors in the mountain of twisted metal, concrete slabs, bricks and mortar. The cause of the building collapse was not immediately clear.

According to police officials, there had been unusually heavy rain in Vadodara during monsoon season this year, which potentially could have damaged the foundation of the two buildings.

The Gujarat government has ordered an investigation into the collapse and will check for structural damage in the 31 other buildings in the complex, Taparia said.

Building collapses are common in India. Builders cut corners by using substandard materials and multistory structures are often built without proper supervision.

A massive demand for housing around India's cities and widespread corruption result in builders adding additional floors to buildings illegally, or putting up whole buildings entirely without proper approval.

In April a building collapse in Mumbai killed 72 people and injured 70 others. Sixty seven people died in November 2010 when a tenement filled with migrant workers collapsed in eastern part of New Delhi, largely a working-class area.

“It can take 45 minutes to move less than a mile,” said Alison Field-Juma, a West Cambridge resident who suffers through the parkway bottleneck daily. “I do anything I can to avoid this. I work longer hours. I start early. But then that affects my family. It didn’t use to be this bad.”

Alewife has always been a tough slog, but the traffic has gotten much worse, residents say, since a housing boom hit the neighborhood. This year alone, more than 1,000 luxury apartments have sprung up around the MBTA station, and another 1,500 high-end units are slated for this side of the city in 2015, as well as office developments.

Worse is that many residents contend the city did not anticipate how bad things would become when it allowed so much building in the area.

With the local economy booming, the spoils of success include many new high-paying jobs at the technology and life sciences companies rushing to open offices in Kendall Square and in Boston’s Innovation District. A boom that is the envy of many around the world, however, has side effects that ripple through the neighborhoods of Boston and Cambridge: spiraling housing prices and a growing anxiety about affordability and economic fairness.

A single person in Boston needs to make $100,000 a year to afford the city’s median rent of $2,497, according to Zillow.

Rents in Cambridge have spiked to levels beyond the reach of many middle-class families. And the gridlock that has inevitably followed this explosion of development on the west side of the city has crystallized the debate for many in Cambridge about their quality of life. From this comes a new generation of residents who are challenging City Hall to better manage the inevitable pressures to grow and expand.

“The planning process in Cambridge is broken,” said Jan Devereux, a West Cambridge resident who founded the Fresh Pond Residents Alliance this year in response to rapid development at Alewife. “The city allows these projects to be planned and approved one at a time, instead of looking at how you build out an entire neighborhood and a city as a whole.”

With more land available than in other sections of the city, West Cambridge has drawn immense interest from major real estate investors. Sitting at the end of the Red Line, the Alewife area offers an easy commute to labs and startups’ offices in Kendall Square.

Like many other municipalities, Cambridge has long had planning guidelines for each neighborhood; often, though, these plans are not followed closely. At Alewife, for example, the amount of development that was anticipated in city documents for the period between 2006 and 2024 was surpassed in 2014, a full decade early.

And instead of bringing a mix of offices, apartments, shops, and outdoor spaces that would have created an urban center with a distinct personality, the boom has brought mostly housing. There remain so many missing elements — from sidewalks to a footbridge over the sprawling commuter rail tracks — that reaching the Red Line can be difficult.

Traffic leaving and entering Cambridge near the intersection of Alewife Brook Parkway and Route 2 routinely creates logjams, as seen in this late November tie-up.

“We were told that when there is more development at Alewife, it would not affect traffic,” Alison Field-Juma said. “But it hasn’t turned out that way.”

The message seems to be getting through to City Hall.

Brian Murphy, assistant city manager in charge of community development, said the residents’ complaints have forced officials to pay closer attention to the fallout from development.

“This new focus on our work reminded us to reexamine what we are doing and how we are doing it,” he said. To appease the residents, the city has organized around 50 community conversations, asking people what they value about living in Cambridge.

In response, Cambridge is developing a citywide plan that would guide development and examine the impact on infrastructure, neighborhood character, and values emphasized by the community, such as social equity and diversity.

In another move, the city replaced some Planning Board members in November after residents complained that the board rubber-stamped special permits sought by every major development before it.

In December, the new Planning Board made the unusual move of discussing its procedures in a round table with the City Council. Board chairman Hugh Russell acknowledged that most projects were reviewed and settled by the time they came up for a public hearing.

“We are planning to change that and involve residents earlier,” vowed Murphy, the development director.

In a city with a culture of civic involvement, inviting more input from residents could lead developers to rethink their proposals.

A new residential complex at 603 Concord Ave., at the corner of Wheeler Street.

In April, when Acorn Holdings and Abodez Development proposed a 93-unit apartment building on New Street near Alewife, residents peppered officials with complaints: The sidewalks were too narrow, there were no bike lanes or other safe ways to reach the MBTA station, for example. They also suggested that the developer include larger units to accommodate more families.

The board has sent the project back to the developer for changes four times.

Conversely, a local developer, Richard McKinnon, had his proposal for a large apartment complex on Cambridgepark Drive sail through in October after he worked with residents to modify the project. Originally, he proposed 378 apartments and a nine-story parking garage behind the Alewife T station. He took steps to keep the neighbors informed, such as posting videos of project presentations on the websites of residents’ groups.

Following the public input, McKinnon reduced the number of apartments to 254 and added more retail and community space, including for shops and a playground.

“This is how it should be done,” said Langley Keyes, former head of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s urban planning department and a member of the Fresh Pond Residents Alliance.

“The city has been extremely reluctant to put pressure on developers and to extract some resources to make it work for the people. So we end up with these buildings plunked down in the middle of nowhere.”

If a caterpillar awoke one morning from uneasy dreams to find it had metamorphosed into a detached house in leafiest Surrey, it might look like this. The Butterfly House is a mutation of a 1930s timber-framed design once shown at the Ideal Home Exhibition. With its bright winged canopies, serpentine pathways and garden that twists through its science-fiction interiors, it must surely be one of the most surreal homes ever to have been built.

Intriguingly, this is not the brainchild of some Mad Hatter-turned-architect but a design by Laurie Chetwood, an architect best known for business parks, branches of Sainsbury's, redesigns of Underground and bus stations, hotels, offices and a distinctly sober-looking brewery.

The Butterfly House is Chetwood's plaything: a building, part mechanical, part organic, that has been growing, as if by itself, from a high bank overlooking a bowl outside Godalming in Surrey for the past four years. It is at once an artwork, a laboratory for architectural experimentation, a part-time family home, a design studio and an attraction, planted with lavender, hebe and buddleia, for bright clouds of butterflies. Constructed of timber, Kevlar sails, steel, copper and plastic ducts, two kilometres of bungee rope, over 100 metres of fibre-optic cables and 50 interwoven carbon-fibre fishing rods, it comes as a delightful shock.

The house is inseparable from its garden, a tangle of natural and artificial roots, tubers and plants. It is hard to tell, as you walk up the ramp to the front door, where nature ends and architecture begins. As the light falls, this extraordinary entrance begins to glow. The light is from the tips of hundreds of fibre-optic cables, as if a swarm of fireflies had come to replace the diurnal butterflies.

Only when you walk into the raised glass entrance lobby do you realise that the house is indeed a gigantic artificial caterpillar in the process of transforming itself into an equally artificial butterfly. The winding entrance path is the multi-legged, pulsing caterpillar; the entrance lobby contains the chrysalis, wrapped around and mutating above a brightly coloured stairwell; the Kevlar sails that burst from the garden in front of the house and flap gently in the wind are the wings of the butterfly. This gigantic insect has wrapped the old house and its studio wing in its tendril-like embrace.

As for living rooms, kitchen, principal bedroom, these are like nothing you have experienced before. Chairs hang from ceilings, tables with folding wings are raised and lowered into position by pulleys, beds sway in webs of rope. Pipes and wires coil and recoil through the kitchen and the bathrooms like jungle creepers in childhood dreams.

The Butterfly House is unprecedented, yet its sometimes dreamy, sometimes nightmarish interiors owe something to the imaginations of Lewis Carroll, Franz Kafka and Jules Verne. There are references to pop art designers such as Roger Dean, and to films by, among others, Terry Gilliam, or Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro. The former's Brazil comes to mind, and the latter's The City of Lost Children.

Chetwood's head is full of this sort of stuff, and he is probably the better architect for it. His practice produces intelligent buildings that push boundaries gently: the elegant, ""eco-friendly"" branch of Sainsbury's near the Millennium Dome in Greenwich; a hotel in Clerkenwell that will sip rather than guzzle energy. He experiments before he designs, so clients get the benefit of the latent mad scientist and thoughtful artist in him without having to pay for buildings that are expressions of his creative frustrations writ large. Too many new buildings seem like the work of architects wanting to play the role of bad boy and brat girl artist. If they kept their games within the confines of computer screens, sheets of paper and cardboard models, we would all benefit. Chetwood plays games with the house, but not with us, his clients or the streets we live and work in.

Yet the Butterfly House is ultimately more than a vision of an architect let loose on high days and holidays. The house really is a research laboratory. It allows the architects of Chetwood Associates to experiment with new materials and technologies. It enables them to explore new forms, to rethink the house and its relationship to both nature and technology. It asks questions about our relationship with new electronics and gadgetry.

Given its experimental nature, the house would be an unsettling place in which to live for long spells. Because it is an R&D lab, it relies on a secret old kitchen and service room that are pressed into use on days when it is used as a family home. The architect, his wife and young children live in a flat in north London; they go down to the Butterfly House to test its latest wiles, gizmos, protrusions and unexpected growths.

There is much to do here. Some of the electronics are troublesome: a car radio on a revolving Perspex stack of shelves is powered by a car battery; sliding seats wobbling around a suspended dining table feel as certain as riding a camel must do for the uninitiated. But none of this cannot be put right, or replaced. Chetwood will keep playing until the garden is bright with butterflies.

Many of our best designers and engineers are tinkerers and tamperers by nature; the more they experiment and test new materials, forms and technologies, the better for the rest of us - most of whom have no wish to buy, use or live in experiments. This has happened far too often over the past 50 years, when people, often those with little or no choice, have been used as guinea pigs to test new forms of housing design and technology. The Butterfly House, far from being a fictional nightmare, proves to be a fascinating and, if sometimes delirious, happy dream.","How do you get into the Butterfly House?

The 56-year-old, who has built a reputation over the past 30 years for crafting improbable structures around the world – from housing to art galleries and cathedrals – many from humble cardboard tubes, has been named as the winner of the 2014 Pritzker prize, the highest accolade in the industry.

""When you finish a roll of tracing paper or fax paper, there are always paper tubes left over,"" he said. ""They were so strong and so nice, so I kept them. Then I went to the factory where they made them, and I saw they could make any length and any diameter.""

Beginning with temporary exhibition designs, his experiments with cardboard engineering soon expanded in scope, from undulating grid-shell pavilions to the geodesic frame of his temporary office in Paris. Strapped limpet-like to the roof of the Pompidou Centre, this cardboard-framed tunnel was his base for designing the gallery's outpost in Metz, completed in 2010, itself conceived as a rippling rattan hat of bamboo and oiled paper.

But it is for his humanitarian work, as much as for his houses and museums, that Ban caught the Pritzker jury's eye. ""He is a force of nature,"" said the jury chairman, Lord Palumbo, ""which is entirely appropriate in the light of his voluntary work for the homeless and dispossessed in areas devastated by natural disasters.""

In 1994, prompted by the displacement of millions by the Rwandan civil war, Ban proposed paper-tube shelters to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, followed a year later by paper log cabins after the Kobe earthquake, with foundations made of sand-filled beer crates and walls of vertical cardboard tubes. After founding the Voluntary Architects' Network in 1995, he has tackled disaster relief in Turkey, India, China and Haiti, most recently erecting a magnificent cardboard cathedral after the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, rising in an elegant A-frame next to the ruins of George Gilbert Scott's stone building.

Ban is the seventh Japanese architect to receive the prize since it was established in 1979, following Kenzo Tange in 1987, Fumihiko Maki in 1993, Tadao Ando in 1995, the team of Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa in 2010, and Toyo Ito last year.

""Receiving this prize is a great honour, and with it, I must be careful,"" said Ban, who splits his time between offices in Tokyo, Paris and New York. ""I must continue to listen to the people I work for, in my private residential commissions and in my disaster relief work. I see this prize as encouragement for me to keep doing what I am doing – not to change what I am doing, but to grow.""",The 56-year-old is renowned for crafting structures from housing to art galleries from cardboard tubes,33.2941176471,0.9411764706,3.0588235294,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

The two disappeared men were named as Nicholas Figueroa, 23, who had been on a date, and 26-year-old restaurant busboy Moises Lucon.

Police had previously said witness statements put both missing people in the sushi restaurant at the time of the explosion.

A total of 22 people were injured in the blast and subsequent fire, including six uniformed personnel.

New York's fire commissioner said it would take a week to clear the debris created by the incident, which leveled three properties and badly damaged a fourth.

The buildings have been destroyed and search and recovery operations took place all weekend, while the area was closed to circulation.

They are located in the bustling East Village neighborhood, home to many bars and restaurants.

A year ago, eight people were killed during a gas explosion that destroyed two apartment buildings in East Harlem.

The heart of Gruber’s analysis is some math posted earlier in the day by Asymco‘s Horace Dediu.

Dediu calculated that the software licenses for Windows and Office generate about $78 in operating profit per PC sold. Apple AAPL , by contrast, generates about $178 per unit operating profit just from the iPad. Microsoft used to make it up in volume, but tablet sales are on a trajectory to overtake sales of traditional PCs, which are in decline.

“So Microsoft faces a dilemma,” Dediu concluded. “Their business model of expensive software on cheap hardware is not sustainable. The future is nearly free software integrated into moderately priced hardware.”

That, writes Gruber, is why Microsoft has decided to compete with the manufacturers that have been its partners since the dawn of the PC era:

“This move was driven by the iPad, but competitively it directly pits Microsoft not against Apple but against Dell, HP, Toshiba, et al. The intention is obviously to slow the iPad down, but the radical shift in Microsoft’s strategy is about the fight over the profits that remain after Apple’s. The math no longer works out for the Windows you-sell-the-hardware-we-sell-the-software model. It works for unit share (cf. Android), but it doesn’t for profit share. Nothing works sustainably in business without profit — profit is the oxygen companies breathe.

“Even if Apple’s growth soon slows, Apple already reaps a massive share of the industry’s profits. And if Apple’s growth doesn’t slow in the next year or two, look out. All of Apple’s competitors in the phone industry, save Samsung, are now starving for profit. They’re dying, all of them — HTC is breaking even and the rest are deep in the red.

“Microsoft Surface is not fundamentally about Microsoft needing to control the entire integrated product in order to compete with the iPad on design. It’s about Microsoft needing to sell the whole thing to sustain its current profitability.”

http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/sep/18/architecture.culturaltrips,http://web.archive.org/web/20140925161057id_/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/sep/18/architecture.culturaltrips,Jonathan Glancey on the Venice Architecture Biennale,1970-08-22 02:42:05.161057,"In Italo Calvino's mesmeric novel Invisible Cities, Marco Polo describes the enchanting, illogical and sometimes dire cities he claims to have visited during his travels through Kubla Khan's huge empire. The Khan is unfazed when Polo reveals that he has really been describing his own city, Venice. For in Venice, every permutation of every element of the high games of architecture and urban planning has been played, in countless fashions and styles, over many centuries. Nowhere, not even in the mighty Khan's immeasurable empire, could offer such architectural richness.

In decline since the 18th century, Venice retains its magnetic draw. It is a truly fantastic place that - even in its dotage, and swamped by tourists -demonstrates how a city of real bricks and stones can be more than a challenge for the best storyteller in the world.

Perhaps this is why at least half the 10th International Architecture Biennale, held in various locations in La Serenissima this autumn, comes as a disappointment. The main exhibition - held in the old naval dockyard, the Arsenale - raises questions of world importance; but the solutions by architects, displayed in the national pavilions in the nearby Public Gardens, are, for the most part, weak, flippant and severely lacking in imagination. There is little here that might have excited Calvino's Marco Polo.

The main show, City: Architecture and Society, occupies the entire Corderie of the Arsenale. This magnificent former naval rope-making factory is 300m long, its great roof held up by massive Doric columns; it could swallow up the most inspired exhibition. Curated by Ricky Burdett, a professor of planning at the London School of Economics and architectural advisor to London mayor Ken Livingstone, the show is an ambitious attempt to raise big questions about the reality and future development of 16 of the world's major conurbations. From Sao Paolo and Caracas, from Mexico City and Los Angeles to London, Istanbul, Mumbai (Bombay), Johannesburg, Shanghai and Tokyo, these feverishly growing settlements are as diverse as those described by Calvino's Marco Polo.

Each city faces many of the same problems: massive immigration, poor housing, huge energy consumption, inadequate public transport, sprawl, loss of identity. Of course, each has a specific character - Berlin is the only one with a declining population - but by the time the dutiful visitor had trekked from one end of Burdett's exhaustive exhibition to the other, one had blurred into the other.

This is fair enough. More than half the world's population now lives in cities, and with the tides of globalisation washing through their streets, these 16 really are becoming more alike in fundamental ways. The same bland buildings appear to line the same banal streets. The same slums tug at the hems of massive, energy-gobbling air-conditioned tower blocks piled up for the wealthy to make ever more money. The same shops are supplied by the same purveyors of what were once ""goods"" but are now ""brands."" Poverty, meanwhile, only grows. As do the cities themselves: by 2050, the show suggests, at least 75% of humankind will be truly urbanised.

Burdett's team have done their best to present the restless character and sense of adventure in each of the 16 cities on display. Graphics are clear. Lettering is big enough to read. There is photography of a high standard. The big, termite's-nest models representing the different densities of these cities, at the core of the Corderie, are exuberantly persuasive. But as one more jazzy computer screen assaults the eye, as you are hit by yet another machine-gun burst of dramatic statistics (did you know that 95% of new Londoners since 1995 were born outside the UK?), it all blurs into one. Although intelligent, the whole is indigestible: there is simply too much information. It's like some giant, ultra-modern edition of Look and Learn.

The importance of the exhibition, though, is that it raises questions that concern all of us, and makes it clear that intelligent architecture goes hand-in-hand with well-planned cities. It shows how such architecture does not need to be big and showy; it might be modest, yet highly effective.

The subtle reconstruction of the ""barrios"", or shantytowns, of Caracas is a good example. Here, urban settlements that have developed organically are being made over, or ""retrofitted"", with the clinics, schools and public spaces they have to date lacked. Here, architects are asked to work with the skill of surgeons to give healthy hearts to these poor, overpopulated places.

Such designs are unlikely to catch the eye of those in search of exciting new buildings, but they have a real and positive impact on the lives of those they are designed for. And they follow the way in which many of our favourite old cities have been retrofitted with sewers, lighting, heating, public squares and parks. Instead of demolishing the barrios and replacing them, when the money is available, with conventional housing estates that might belong anywhere, Caracas is proving that shantytowns that have grown up organically can be nurtured and improved so that, slowly, they become communities of civilised homes. This is one of the highlights of the show - proof that the settlements people create for themselves can, one way or another, become truly urbanised.

You may well disagree, however, with some of the exhibition's conclusions, such as: ""Good governance can deliver good cities."" No one and no organisation can ""deliver"" a city. Milkmen and paper-boys deliver; a city grows. Good governance can only help. ""Only governments can turn the principle of a new urban agenda into action, enlisting the services of designers and planners in the process."" Untrue. Governments, local or national, often do harm to cities; much of the best development over the centuries has been by enlightened patrons, guilds, companies, developers and public corporations. The best-loved cities have grown through a marriage of formal planning, whether led by monarchs, religious leaders or civic government, and natural, organic development; the trick today is for architects, planners, politicians and everyone else to keep the two in balance.

Whatever your political beliefs, you might well hope, as you stroll to the individual national exhibition pavilions, to see some imaginative ideas addressing the issues raised in Burdett's show. Most of all, you might expect to see some new architecture. No such luck. For whatever reason, this year the curators of the pavilions have decided to try to ape Venice's Art Biennale, and instal what are presumably meant to be witty, ironic, allusive and provocative visual commentaries on life in cities today.

So, the French offer a 1968-style ""happening"". Their pavilion has been turned into a kind of Maison Grand Frère, in which architects with wry expressions have been living night and day: cooking, blogging, taking saunas. Perhaps this is some profound comment on the urban condition de nos jours. Perhaps not. Who cares?

The Spanish pavilion, normally home to some of that country's above-average modern architecture, has been transformed into what appears to be a parody of a cosmetics department. The British pavilion is something to do with everyday life in Sheffield. It involves grown-ups sitting down at school tables and making collages with scissors and paper. The Hungarian pavilion is decorated with hundreds of brightly coloured plastic penguins hanging from the ceiling. I am not making this up. Significant or what?

In the Canadian pavilion, I was asked if I would like to ride a stationary bicycle in front of a computer screen. (This, by the way, turned out to be the Computer Screen Biennale - it is all but impossible to get away from these digital bores.) By pedalling at different speeds, I would be able to discover how much energy goes into recycling plastic bottles consumed in Canadian cities. Or something like that.

Only the US pavilion seemed to have any sense of purpose. It looked at the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which washed away much of New Orleans, and its poverty-stricken population, last year. Daringly, the Americans even included an architectural model, made of old-fashioned, non-digital wood, representing not a wry, telling witticism, but an impressive design for what looked to be a pretty good social housing project. Rather like the retrofitting of the Caracas barrios, the reconstruction of large parts of New Orleans is aimed at modernising parts of the old city with a little imagination and care, rather than thumping down new housing projects. The US architectural profession is clearly struggling with the issue, and this exhibition shows that there is real commitment to improve New Orleans and to face up to the fact that whatever buildings emerge, future hurricanes will strike them, too.

Curiously, and rather disturbingly, the only solid - all too solid - architecture on show this year is in one of the old dockyard buildings back at the Arsenale. City of Stone, curated by Claudio d'Amato Guerrieri, professor of architectural planning at Bari Polytechnic, is a handsome celebration of fascist Italian architecture from the 1920s, to the mid-1950s (long after Mussolini's death in 1945). Superb black and white photographs idolise such overbearing designs as the Casa del Comandi dei Carabinieri, Bari, designed by the appropriately named Cesare Bazzani, and completed in 1936.

If this is odd, march to the other side of the exhibition hall. This has been given over to displays of monumental and ingloriously vulgar new stone buildings planned for southern Italian cities. Can these be serious? Yes. The Duce is dead; long live the Duce!

Now, this is a curious state of affairs. Imagine yourself to be a big-time developer, or a mayor, or an idealistic patron wanting to do some good in your city. You would walk through the main show, building up a head of steam and statistics. But what sort of architecture, and which architects, might you turn to, to transform statistics into plans and buildings? Off you go to the Public Gardens. The French architects are cooking or else in the sauna (again). The Hungarians offer plastic penguins. The British hand you scissors, paper and Blue Peter-style sticky-back plastic.

In despair, you turn to City of Stone, to be offered new fascist architecture. Sensibly, though, having gone back through the main show in the Corderie at the Arsenale, you turn to Venice itself. If determined citizens had once created such a beautiful, mysterious, celebratory city on the waters of a lagoon, surely today we might yet bring some beauty, imagination, sensuality, intelligence and humanity to the design, and redesign, of areas of Caracas, Cairo and Shanghai.

The 10th Architecture Biennale, or at least the largely infantile national pavilions in the Public Gardens, suggests that we should have a go, but without the help of architects. They are too busy trying to be fine artists, curators, pseudo-comedians, or else they are making supper, texting, blogging or sweating in the sauna. Italo Calvino's Marco Polo would have had a wonderfully satirical story to tell Kubla Khan: the tale of a city where the architects do everything except design buildings

Now, they’re getting a do-it-yourself upgrade, making them quite possibly the only artisanal tram system in the world.

As the senior engineering manager for Hong Kong Tramways, Steven Chan’s job is to replace each of the 161 vehicles with new, aluminium-bodied trams that are lighter, faster and longer-lasting — all while looking like they have for more than a century. The new trams, which have been gradually rolling into service since 2012, are built entirely by hand, using DIY equipment and homespun techniques.

As he walks through the Whitty Street Tram Depot, pointing out decades-old bending machines and jerry-rigged wheel cutters, Chan seems like the happiest man in Hong Kong. “The tram is my laboratory”, he says, grinning.

These trams are something of a Hong Kong treasure — and the city’s residents see them as a souvenir of its history. This urban centre has developed at a ferocious pace, and the scarcity of land in its central districts means that many plots have been redeveloped four or five times in the last century. The trams are some of the few visible links to the past.

Last year, when retired town planner Sit Kwok-keung proposed to the Town Planning Board that the “outdated” trams be scrapped in order to improve traffic flow, many citizens were apoplectic. The board was flooded with nearly 22,000 letters in support of preserving the trams. It ultimately rejected Sit’s proposal.

What’s more, in 2000, the tram company unveiled a new, more streamlined tram called the Millennium model, which ditched the classic design’s open-air second level and defiantly angular shape for a sleekly enclosed front end and rounded edges. People hated it. “They thought it looked like a bus,” says Emmanuel Vivant, the tram company’s managing director. He sees it as a “warning sign” that Hongkongers see the tram not just as a way to get around, but as a piece of the city’s heritage.

This is no novelty operation for tourists, either. Hong Kong’s tram system includes six routes, 120 stations and 30 kilometres of tramway track, carrying 180,000 passengers each day, many of them drawn by the dirt-cheap fare of HK$2.30 (20p) — about a tenth the price of a cup of black coffee in Hong Kong’s central business district.

What makes the ding-ding trams different from other “heritage” transit systems of the world, which tend to be tourist-serving novelties — think San Francisco’s cable cars — is that locals actually use the Hong Kong trams.

So, given all of those factors, it was never an option for Hong Kong Tramways to buy its vehicles from Bombardier, Alstom, Siemens, or any of the other huge companies that dominate the public transport market. City leaders wanted to ensure this Hong Kong icon would be made in Hong Kong.

“It’s a small series, it’s customised, so it would be much more expensive than what we would be able to do in house”, says Vivant. Plus: “There is no better heritage tram builder in the world than us, so why not do it ourselves?”

The system first opened in 1903, with a single track that ran from the Kennedy Town on the west end of Hong Kong Island to Causeway Bay in the east. The line was soon extended to Shau Kei Wan, a fishing village on the island’s far eastern edge. By 1912, demand was high enough that British-made double-decker trams were introduced.

When the Japanese invaded and occupied Hong Kong between 1941 and 1945, they left the tram system in ruins. The end of the war provided an opportunity to rebuild the network with double tracks and new trams that were designed and built in Hong Kong.

These 1950s-era trams are the same in form as those in operation today, with doors on each end, two narrow staircases and windows that can be opened for ventilation. Generations of Hongkongers can recall sitting in the front seat of the tram’s upper deck, wind blowing through their hair as they rumble through the city’s neon-lit streets.

Over the years, the old trams were becoming increasingly unreliable, with teakwood frames that required replacement every seven years and heavy DC motors that drivers said were clunky to operate. In 2010, the company decided to do everything from scratch. It was Chan, who started his career as an aircraft mechanic before joining the tram company in 1996, who drew up the plans to rebuild the trams without outside help.

“That’s the only thing left”, he says, pointing to a bare chassis parked in the tram depot. Nearby, wood-framed trams sat in various stages of disassembly. Walking over to a bare tram face lying on its side, Chan explains how the new vehicles, known as Signature model trams, are assembled.

First, a team of five people takes apart the tram piece by piece and installs new lightweight AC motors on the chassis. Another five workers cut aluminium to make the frame. Next comes the electrical and mechanical work, followed by the installation of seats, stairs and windows. The whole process takes about 10 weeks. “In a year we should be able to produce 12 to 15 trams”, says Chan. “We’ve made 54 so far.”

The new process required engineering ingenuity. The tram’s low fares mean revenues are modest, so Chan had to keep costs down. He adapted sometimes ancient machinery, like a 1920s-era Scottish machine that makes tram wheels, which he turned into a more accurate, computer programmable CNC cutter, increasing the lifespan of a wheel from seven months to 24. “Most of our machines are very, very old,” says Chan.

There was also a learning curve for workers. “Our workers had always used wood, so they didn’t know how to cut metal,” says Chan. “The good thing is that everyone has a sense of pride”, because they make everything from scratch. Since most transport systems use vehicles made by major companies, parts are standardised and easy to buy. Not so for Hong Kong’s one-of-a-kind tram. “Even spare parts — if we need something, we can’t order it. We have to make it ourselves”, says Chan.

On the outside, the new trams are virtually indistinguishable from the old, except for an LED destination screen that replaces a hand-painted placard. Inside, the new trams have softer lighting, automated stop announcements, and more handles for standing passengers. The tram company’s carpenters haven’t been put entirely out of work: each of the new tram’s seats are made from hand-cut teak, an improvement over the flimsy plastic bucket seats that filled most of the old trams.

Chan says the new aluminium frames will last around 40 years before needing an overhaul. It’s hard to say what the tram system will be like in that time.

Ridership dropped by 10% last year when a new subway extension opened in Kennedy Town. Congestion on many parts of the island means that taking the tram can be as slow as walking. But Vivant insists the tram is still competitive on short distances, and its low fare serves a social purpose in a city with an increasingly large gap between rich and poor.

Since joining the tram company in 2012, when it was bought by RATP Dev Transdev Asia, the international branch of Paris’ public transport company, Vivant has overseen the redesign of maps and wayfinding signage, and introduced an app with real-time operational information. The tram company has also convinced the government to synchronise traffic lights in order to speed up tram service, and it is lobbying to restore reserved tram lanes that were long ago removed to accommodate bus and car traffic.

Ironically, Sit Kwok-keung’s proposal to scrap the trams may have been their saviour. The strong opposition to Sit’s plan has bolstered the Des Voeux Road Central Initiative, which aims to turn a major stretch of Hong Kong’s central business district into a dedicated corridor for trams and pedestrians. Vivant says he is heartened by the idea that trams should play a central role in Hong Kong’s streets.

“The team here now feels even more committed than before, because we know that the tram not only belongs to Hong Kong Tramways, it belongs to the Hong Kong people”, he says. “We are proud of it but it carries a great responsibility. We want to be worthy of it.”

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit today overturned, in part, a lower court's ruling against the Environmental Defense Fund and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad.

The 252-mile waterway, now 55 percent complete, would link the Tennessee River with the Gulf of Mexico by cutting a canal between the Tennessee and Tombigbee Rivers in northeastern Mississippi.

The environmental group and the railroad filed a lawsuit in 1976 against the waterway, arguing that the corps had failed to publish supplementary environmental impact statements on extensive modifications to the original design.

The corps filed its first statement in 1971, based on a 1966 study, and Congress allocated funds. ''But by late 1974 the corps had initiated design changes costing about $330 million,'' the court said. ''The corps decided to commission a new economic analysis of the waterway.''

A 1976 analysis disclosed the scope of the modifications, which included a 350 percent increase in traffic, a 150 percent increase in total land use, creation of a 45-mile ''chain of lakes'' and straightening of 21 miles of the Tombigbee River.

The court said that the sole issue before it was the ''reasonableness'' of the corps' decision that the changes would not have substantial environmental impact. ''We find no solid evidence that the corps has ever asked the right question, much less answered it reasonably,'' the court said.

The court ordered the corps to prepare a supplementary impact statement for all of the changes. The court enjoined the construction or letting of contracts on the ''chain of lakes'' and the 21-mile stretch of the Tombigbee as well as ''any activity significantly affecting the environment of the land acquisitions planned after 1971.''","A Federal appeals court has halted construction on parts of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway until the Army Corps of Engineers can file a new assessment of the impact of the $1.8 billion barge canal on the environment.

Global “Big Pharma” is increasingly looking for smart ways to tap China’s healthcare market, estimated by consultancy IMS Health to be worth around $185 billion by 2018. From investing in China facilities to acquisitions, licensing deals, and joint ventures, the aim is to seek an edge in dealings with domestic regulators and government.

John Young, group president for Pfizer’s essential health division, said in the statement that the Hangzhou facility should “help support China’s aim to increase the complexity and value of its manufacturing sector by 2025.”

Pfizer pfe said it would work closely with local regulators to bring the drugs to market as soon as possible. The center will focus mostly on biologic drugs—made from living micro-organisms rather than chemically synthesised—and lower-cost “biosimilars,” generic versions of biologics.

Pharmaceutical executives have long complained about the slow process of getting drugs to market in China, while others have run up against regulatory roadblocks. Pfizer had to close its vaccine business in the country last year after a license for its top-selling vaccine Prevenar was not renewed.

In the article below we stated that ""the highest proportion of British people now live in single-occupancy units"" we should have made it clear that this is a trend and not an absolute figure. At 27% of all households, according to National Statistics, it is historically high and growing - and much higher than the average family with 2.4 children. Households with two adults and either two or three children comprise 16% of the total.

This weekend's Grand Designs Live exhibition at Excel showed us that, after all the hype and hustle, though there is a little new and more not so new technology, there is no new thinking about British domestic architecture. Excel itself is nothing but a blind tin hangar that can make no better use of its stunning site than to surround itself with hectares of crumbling, rutted Tarmac for cars to park on, maximal environmental impact for minimal reward.

The hub of the Grand Designs layout was a wheel of pink fabric from which depended a twinkling verrerie wittily carried out in yellow-handled screwdrivers; to get to it you were supposed to walk through a tunnel of the same gingivitis pink. If you suspected that someone was having a cheap laugh at your expense, you had Dairmuid Gavin's Never-Ending Garden to prove it, silver birches in pots standing in serried ranks within an enclosure lined with stick-on mirror plastic, the pots covered with live turf to make mounds in which were placed stakes holding packets of the kinds of seeds that might grow in such a situation. It was a suggestion, but, like virtually all the ideas in the exhibition, not a new one. Some of us have been using mirror plastic for 30 years.

The star of Grand Designs Live was yet another German kit home, with a steel frame supporting wooden posts and beams and glass curtain walling, under a huge overhanging roof. If there is anything new about Huf Haus homes it's their size. The kit house has achieved grandiosity. Before this edifice can begin its miraculous three-day rise, the ground must be excavated, and a concrete slab laid; what Huf Haus calls wood is actually newly felled spruce, or similar, sawn into wafer thin slices that are glued together to prevent warping. At Grand Designs Live nothing was quite what it seemed. The lady trying to interest me in an amazingly complicated system for recycling grey water didn't know that it needed to be driven by an electric pump.

The intractable obstacle to creativity in British domestic architecture is the identification of home with house. Ask a child to draw you a house and a 100-to-one she'll draw you a square with a triangle on top, three rectangles within the square, and a rhomboid on one side or other of the triangle with a corkscrew coming out of it: facade with door and two windows, pitched roof, chimney. It probably wouldn't matter if she were a Tuareg living in a felt tent, or a Tigrayan crouching in a tukul; the icon of the house/home would be the same. The homepage icon on your laptop is not a teepee or an igloo or the Trump Tower; it is the same pesky house.

Baron Haussmann obviously believed that apartments could be just as much homes as houses, and the result is a beautiful city. Palace is just another name for an apartment block, as Elizabeth II and every Italian have always known. Stacking dwellings on top of each other is the best way of reducing the built footprint; apartment blocks may stand in properly managed common land that provides habitat for the full range of species. They require less footpath, less hardstand; people who live in them in New York or Hong Kong can more easily do without cars.

But this is not what a Briton means by an ideal home. The ideal home is a fantasy environment for a fantasy family that, if it ever comes into being, will hang together for less than 20 years. By far the highest proportion of British people now live in single-occupancy units, but there is no new thinking about how to combine them for maximum benefit to environment or inhabitants.

People who say that they want a home of their own mean that they want a house. They aren't looking for a lean-to on the roof of a factory or a five bedroom flat in a luxury mansion block or a studio in a downtown co-op, but a house. They want to own their pleasure dome from the ground up, and they want it freehold. This demand has condemned us to hundreds of square kilometres of undistinguished suburbia, and will condemn us to hundreds more. Part of the Grand Designs operation is to assist would-be house owners in the search for a plot. Some of the merchants touting their wares at Excel were selling subdivided parcels of land just big enough for people to put too much house on. In Europe such developments insist on provision for car-parking underneath the house, but the young men in suits lounging round the model developments on the stand at Excel thought that parking in the street was fine, even though it meant 200 houses gazing at a landscape populated by more than 400 cars. On another stand young men were trying to sell, for £25,000 or so, hydraulically operated garages that you could stow underground, so you could park another car on top.

The dream home is a monument to the inhabitants' capacity for self-pleasuring, crammed with entertainment centres, luxury bathrooms, jacuzzi, hot tub, swimming pool. Beds, even children's beds, are enormous. Children have rooms, and entertainment centres, of their own. Most of the time this many-windowed barn is empty; adults are at work, children at school or after-school. The tiny family seldom sits down at the vast dining-table to dine together. The table and the room are for entertaining, or showing off the inhabitants' level of consumption.

Kevin McCloud and Channel 4 knew what they were doing when they called their flagship series Grand Designs. Observers of a future age will wonder why, as the British family shrank, the British home grew and grew, until it was catastrophically enormous. Never had so few people required so much illuminated, climate-controlled and upholstered space to knock about in. But this is the generation that has become aware of environmental issues. The acres of glass will be triple glazed, the floors of timber from renewable sources, the megalitres of water used to wash bodies and clean clothes will be recycled for washing the cars.

When Mrs Thatcher conceived the brilliant wheeze of getting council tenants to buy the houses they lived in, she might have known that they would become slaves to their houses, incessantly adding to them, upgrading, remodelling, redecorating, modernising, refitting, rejigging, endlessly tarting up and tarting down again. People waxing passionate about the size and cost of their extensions can be relied upon to leave politics to the politicians. The proletariat having morphed into the property-owning democracy, divine discontent would be replaced by aspirationalism and positive thinking. Life would become lifestyle. People in glass houses with hefty mortgages are not interested in throwing stones.

It would be nice to be able to say that the result of all this house fetishism is that the standard of British domestic architecture is improving, and even more wonderful to be able to announce that the devastating environmental impact of the spread of housing is being significantly mitigated by the adoption of new building techniques, but there is no evidence for any such case. Triple glazing might minimise heat loss and energy consumption, but the expansion in the house size probably more than accounts for it. The house is moreover crammed with rapidly obsolescing objects that are extremely expensive and difficult to recycle. Driveways, roads and sidewalks are all paved, removing hectares of habitat. The up-to-date garden is a conglomerate of decking, patio, and other forms of hard landscaping, a batless, toadless, outdoor room where insects must be zapped.

When the government announces that hundreds of thousands of new homes are to be built, we all know that they will be built in suburban-style developments, bungaloid or semi-detached, all facing streets full of parked cars. To suggest that the houses stand in common land, that they live within the type of natural habitat that existed before the houses were built, that the residents park their cars at the perimeter or keep no cars at all and use buses instead, is to cry for the moon. The very planning regulations are against any such innovations. To wander around the Grand Designs exhibition was to realise that, despite Kevin McCloud and despite individuals building houses out of straw or wooden Meccano from Finland, the British house is still an environmental disaster.","Grand Designs Live proved one thing:  that the British idea of what a house should be is a disaster, says Germaine Greer.",66.0769230769,0.7307692308,1.1923076923,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Instead, a scheme involving smashing down a sea wall and allowing 183 hectares of West Sussex to be flooded is the 2014 winner of the Prime Minister’s Better Public Building Award, it was announced on Wednesday night.

In a move that may boost morale at the Environment Agency, which was heavily criticised over its response to last winter’s serious flooding despite having to cope with deep budget cuts, the agency’s project to destroy the existing sea wall at Medmerry and build four miles of new sea walls further inland was chosen ahead of far more glamorous projects for its success in protecting more than 300 homes from inundation.

Other buildings on the shortlist for the annual prize included a new maths institute in Oxford, designed by Rafael Viñoly, and the British Museum extension, by Richard Rogers. Previous winners include Tate Modern art gallery and the velodrome at the Olympic park.

The Medmerry scheme was initially criticised as a waste of its £27m budget and locals scoffed at that amount of money being spent on what they complained was a bird reserve. But when the storms hit in January, property was saved from flooding.

In February, during severe flooding on the Somerset levels, the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, blamed the Environment Agency for issuing poor advice, saying “we thought we were dealing with experts”.

It's in one of the rougher parts of central London, a loser in the postcode lottery, the wrong side of the noisy, smelly Westway. It's in sight of Notting Hill, but socially and economically remote from it. This part of Paddington was described in pioneer sociologist Charles Booth's Poverty Map of London in 1898 as home to the 'vicious, semi-criminal' classes.

Nowadays, it is home to an educational constituency virtually none of whom has English as a native language. But it remains gritty, if no longer so vicious. This was a stimulus to the academy's architect Paul Monaghan of Allford Hall Monaghan Morris. Monaghan, a Liverpudlian whose own school was founded on a scary Christian Brothers culture of punishment and damnation, says: 'We're interested in gritty.' Happily, his interest in grit transcends the limitations of the subject.

Architects have not been bothered much by schools. In 1970, the great Nikolaus Pevsner gave the Mellon Lectures in Washington's National Gallery of Art. They were published six years later as A History of Building Types; schools did not even justify a chapter, although prisons and hotels did.

The 1870 Education Act brought some conceptual innovations in the structure of schools, including classes arranged by age. But the board schools arising from it were mostly designed with cash cost rather than human values in mind (so are, therefore, in their way richly revealing of a dominant educational psychology). Hobbled by exiguous budgets and unimaginative briefs, inflexible clients and careless inhabitants, state-school design was often boring mediocrity. Worse, stultifying crap.

There was a bold postwar experiment in Hunstanton, Norfolk, by husband-and-wife team Peter and Alison Smithson (who also designed Robin Hood Gardens, the threatened council housing complex in east London) now demonised by the architecture minister, Margaret Hodge, who does not know anything about architecture. Hunstanton was exceptional and proved a rule. Often photographed, influential among architects, not much imitated, the Hunstanton School was Modernist idealism before familiarity debased its currency.

In Sarasota, Florida, Paul Rudolph's airy, slight and spacious Riverview High School of 1957, a monument to America's late-flowering Enlightenment, is being demolished to make a car park. It is the subject of a sentimental preservation campaign, as was the Brutalist Pimlico School in London late last year.

Strange that masterpiece state schools are so rare, especially if you accept, as you surely must, the architectural argument that we form our environments and our environments form us. Certainly, in my case, the Gothic sandstone, stained glass and dark wood of a school in suburban parkland, managed by an Eton refugee who had mysteriously escaped to Liverpool, made my psychology. Somehow, school suggested stability, security and quality, but light and hope and speed were elsewhere.

Westminster Academy is the latest and most impressive of the hundred or so academies built since 2000. These may yet prove to be Tony Blair's most impressive legacy. Like most of Blair's inheritance, the idea was originally Mrs Thatcher's. Academies began as city technology colleges. Commercial sponsors would give cash and inspiration to schools failing on account of semi-vicious criminality and grit. Lord Ashworth's ADT College in Wandsworth, south London, was among the first. Seventeen years later, Westminster, with its 1,175 pupils, is the gift of David Dangoor, an Iraqi-born property developer.

Seen from the road, it is startlingly green. Five storeys of glazed terracotta from lime to holly via Gordon's Gin sit on a plinth clad in British racing green ceramic (an AC Cobra sports car was one of the sources on the designers' mood boards). 'It's just a box,' Monaghan says, 'but expensively clad.' It looks confident and optimistic. Seen from the Westway, it reads not as a punitive educational institution, but as smart and as corporate as GlaxoSmithKline.

Monaghan has kept this feeling inside. It is much more Hyatt Regency, even New York's Museum of Modern Art, than Dotheboys Hall with a reception desk and wall-mounted plasma screens, although security arrangements make you wistful for the days of the lash; the street entrance can be sealed as an airlock in the event of internal insurrection or external invasion. There is often a police officer inside stroking her stab vest. The register is taken online.

'We've picked cheap things, but thought about where they should go,' Monaghan says. There are many satisfying and ingeniously frugal architectural details: the chandelier that illuminates the insurrectionists' airlock comprises a dozen off-the-shelf fluorescent tubes hung on cable. The wonderfully colourful giant white, green and yellow baffles (or slats) that moderate the sunshine flooding in through the vast central 'light chimney' are MFI door blanks costing about £40 a pop.

The architecture both expresses and helps direct a new educational philosophy. Rigidity went the way of the cane. Academies must respect key stage testing, but do not have to follow the national curriculum. This ventilates both the style of teaching and the plan of the building. The way it was explained to me was: we don't do French language and history, we do 'Napoleon'. This way, pupils learn about motivational leadership and acquire French language and history at the same time.

The cant expression is: education must be competence-based, not subject-based, although with a billed event on spirituality from Esther Rantzen, I do not know what to make of it. To accommodate this freely structured education, large, well-lit rooms (not in any meaningful way 'class' rooms) are arranged around the perimeter of the box, facing an atrium, spacious, but unthreatening. Furniture is mid-century modern design classics by Charles Eames. There are Jasper Morrison stacking chairs, bar stools by Konstantin Grcic. Amazing, really.

Everywhere there is exposed concrete - 'so you don't waste money on a horrible suspended ceiling' - and this looks very handsome. Everywhere there are agit-prop slogans, once the province of the counterculture. Bold hyper-graphics by Studio Myerscough declaim 'Communication!' 'Global citizenship!' 'Enterprise!' In nice contrast, rooms used for business education have City buzzwords vinyl-cut on the glass. The way I used to learn Virgil, Westminster Academicians learn about 'bracket creep', 'hurdle rate' and 'gazundering'.

Outside, the site has been carefully considered as a whole. There is pleasantly textured, resin-bound aggregate underfoot and a sports centre, like all academy facilities shared with the community, is in warm and pleasant untreated larch. There is no fuel-thirsty air conditioning, but elegant mechanical air handling, which leaves a silent, sealed building. Trees are lit at night as an advertisement for a larger social role. Lavatories have twin exits to obviate threatening behaviour. Everyone gets a stand-alone or sit-alone cubicle and Monaghan has spent money on good, robust finishes because, in the long run, that's an economy.

What does Westminster say about educational architecture today? First, it says here's an interesting , emerging tradition of quality building design. Foster and Rogers have already designed academies. So too have Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios and Wilkinson Eyre. Westminster seems certain to be shortlisted for the Stirling Prize. Pleasant to think that a school dedicated to enterprise might excite ambitious competition among architects and sponsors, pushing buildings and pupils ever higher up a helix of growing expectations. Let's hope.

Students lunch on shawarma, fish and chips and chicken fajitas in the Sky Dining Area. So an open concept in education is matched by a splendidly uninhibited culinary curriculum, to be enjoyed on a terrace with generous views. I felt not much regret for cabbage and spotted dick.

The plan includes what architects call caves and commons, a mixture of shared, open circulation and semi-private seclusion. In the latter, study groups of troglodytes meet in caves named after world cities to contemplate Apprentice-like business tasks.

An architecture of space and light with exhilarating long views plays its part in an educational culture of openness and experiment. And everywhere there is a sense of thoughtfulness and economy. Alison Banks, the principal, said that, at its predecessor, children were sullen and given to occasional chair fights. Now the energy is altogether more positive; the building is a teacher in its own right.

Paul Monaghan had several inspirations. Bauhaus textiles influenced the layering of the ceramic facades. MC Escher prints were an ironic source for the mirror-image Scissor Stairs. 'This,' he said, waving a hand and thinking of Magritte, as I queasily remembered the horrors of Latin prep and cold showers, 'is not a school.'

Cool schools: five of the best

Mossbourne Community Academy London E8 (2004)

Richard Rogers Partnership's response to a unique IT curriculum was a V-plan in three storeys, one of the largest timber-framed buildings in Britain. Using the language of village and cloisters, the design aims to achieve 'ownership, equality and heart'.

The Michael Tippett School London SE24 (2008)

London Eye designers Marks Barfield have used colour therapeutically in this special-needs school. This is the first BSF (Building Schools for the Future) project in London, a government initiative that - at last - recognises how architectural quality can influence teaching and behaviour.

The John Madejski Academy Reading (2007)

This design by Wilkinson Eyre was chosen by the DfES as an exemplar. Learning 'clusters' are raw concrete with external clear and opaque glass curtain walls, gathered around an internal 'agora' covered by a polymer roof printed with a dot matrix. Flexible spaces are designed to accept new technologies.

The Thomas Deacon Academy Peterborough (2007)

This academy was sponsored by Perkins Engines and was designed by Foster + Partners; 2,200 pupils specialise in maths and science in a building replicating the atmosphere of a university rather than a school. The sinuous plan reflects Foster's 1970s Wills Faber & Dumas building in Ipswich.

Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios specialises in socially responsible and environmentally intelligent buildings. This wood and brick school is sited in a landscaped park intended to create the feel of an established village. SB","Sterility in school architecture has gone the way of the cane...

In commending Container City, Trinity Buoy Wharf, London in this article, we should have credited the architects, Nicholas Lacey and Partners.

At Trinity Buoy Wharf, by London's only lighthouse, is Container City - a group of artists' and designers' studios converted from old shipping containers. It was the inspired idea of a developer called Eric Reynolds, who had the vision to realise that this isolated site on the Thames, opposite the Millennium Dome, had enormous potential. He also wanted to help artists and designers to find affordable studios, which is increasingly difficult in the capital.

There are about 12 working units here now, made out of 15 40ft containers. The origins of the containers have not been disguised, but they have been cheered up with orange and red paint. Some people have punched holes in them to let some light in. The whole thing is wonderfully witty and refreshing.

Not every building by the Thames in London is so successful. Some, such as Mondial House near London Bridge, are dire. It looks like three shallow buildings stacked and stepped on top of each other, and it squats by the river, apparently windowless. It feels like a carpark or a prison. No one ever seems to know who the architect was, though it was built in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and it's hard to grasp how anyone allowed it to be put up. So much of the river has come alive in recent years, but this stretch still looks terrible. Mondial House is just a blob, and it scars the riverscape.

Nicholas Serota, the Tate's impeccable director, was keen at heart to commission a brand new building - what might have been a British rival to Frank Gehry's crowd-pulling Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. In his head, though, Serota knew that the conversion of London's Bankside power station, set directly across the Thames from St Paul's cathedral, was an ideal choice.

This decommissioned temple of power offered masses of space and was relatively new. Begun in 1947, it was given a handsome makeover by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (1880-1960), architect of Battersea power station, Waterloo Bridge, the red telephone box, Liverpool cathedral and the Guinness brewery in Park Royal, west London. It was completed as late as 1963 and puffed exhaust steam from its twin turbines through a tall single chimney high into the London cloudscape until it was shut down in 1981. The steel and brick structure was battleship- sound. The conversion to art gallery and the architects' direct and intelligent method of working won over every major conservation group.

The location was superb. Brooding on the banks of the Thames beside the Globe theatre, Bankside power station was the architectural prow of the rapidly regenerating London borough of Southwark, one of the capital's poorest and oldest quarters. The borough was keen to house the new Tate. Just as the power station would be transformed into a modern art gallery, so the borough intended to rebrand itself - to use the political jargon that emerged in the mid-90s - with culture, not industry, to the fore.

To cap it all, Southwark and the City of London decided to join hands across the river in the form of the nearly complete Millennium footbridge, designed by Norman Foster, Anthony Caro and the engineer Chris Wise. Tate Modern would thus be at the centre of a route through Southwark, across the Thames and via St Paul's to the City one way, the West End the other. How could the Tate go wrong?

It did not. The site was acquired from Magnox plc in 1996, the super-smooth steam turbines were removed (sadly) and conversion work began the next year. The result is now almost ready to show to the public. How big this public will be perhaps no one really knows; it will certainly be in the millions, and the building is so vast and so solidly put together that it will take millions more each year to make Tate Modern feel anything like congested.

The interior spaces are huge. Even artists who are used to working on an epic scale will find it a challenge to make an impression on the vast space set aside for temporary installations in the former turbine hall. This is now a gigantic entrance hall, 500ft long and 115ft high (the height of the vaults of our loftiest cathedrals). It is a truly public space. Commuters can walk through it on their way north and south across the river, taking in a glimpse of art, a coffee and London's biggest art bookshop (open late seven days a week) on the way.

Jacques Herzog compares it to the great 19th-century galleria of Milan and Naples. But the big difference is that where the Galleria Vittorio Emmanuele in Milan and its counterparts elsewhere in Italy are exuberances of rich materials and colour, full of chic shops and cafes, Herzog and de Meuron's galleria is an austere space. It has something of a nuclear power station about it, or some Brobdingnagian railway station: Milan centrale looms to mind. Visitors here seem Liliputian, the tiniest actors upon an almost impossibly imposing stage. On one side is the three-level stack of galleries facing the river, punctuated by great bands of projecting windows set around with further bands of muted fluorescent light. It is cool, calculated, and deeply impressive.

On the other side is the wall marked out by a regular rhythm of steel columns that separates the galleria and the galleries from the electricity distribution station that continues to hum on site, if out of sight. The hum acts as a kind of white noise, weird or rather wonderful, depending on your point of hearing.

To the fore is a massive bridge at the centre of the galleria. This is the point where lifts and escalators meet and take visitors up to the long enfilades of painting and sculpture galleries. Beyond is the temporary exhibition space and above the dramatic internal hoist that rumbles the length of the galleria: once it lifted turbines, now Serras and other artistic heavyweights.

Reconciling modern artworks, especially the latest installations, to the epic scale and horny-handed might of this former power station is initially peculiar. This was a blue-collar building, a mighty industrial heart pumping lifeblood through the arteries of the capital. I remember coming here as a child and hearing the turbines switched over. There were men in boiler suits, men in brown coats checking and men in white coats checking those checking. There were dials with red sections labelled ""Danger""; gangways and steel stairs zig- zagging into an internal stratosphere; great shafts of murky industrial-era light groping through Scott's high windows. I remember the sheer sense of awe. All that barely contained energy.

And now? There is a certain sense of detachment. Much of the art seems decadent to me - bourgeois playthings hung in a building that was once so vital to the working of its city.

It can, though, be argued that London owes much of its appeal and energy, its continual reinvention of itself, to its inward investment in art and culture, to what Labour ministers call ""cultural industries"". The wall that separates the electricity supply station from Herzog & de Meuron's chaste galleria is thus an unbreachable barrier between old and new London, soot and Serra, energy and Emin, mechanical and digital, cockneys and mockneys, modern and postmodern.

This is not a criticism, but a feeling. The art on display is an eclectic collection - truly something for everyone - in precise white galleries, some with views out to St Paul's diffused by net curtain-like screens, others enclosed, like that displaying the intensely layered red and purple canvases of Mark Rothko. This parade of rooms - untreated oak floors, white walls, sturdy under foot grilles for heating and ventilation, broad strips of overhead light - would seem relentless if not for the sudden glazed cut-throughs and balconies that offer near-vertiginous views down into the galleria and its Liliputians and out through the massive west window. Sadly, here the view is of a rather unsuccessful miscegenation of second-rate buildings of the past four decades. Tate Modern looks down on them with a disdainful, unyielding eye.

Herzog & de Meuron have installed on top of the building, and from one end to the other, a restaurant with river views. Down below is a cafe and brasserie that can be reached without entering the Tate. This is a good idea. It means that, together with the other galleries, cafes, bars and new housing that are following in the titanic wake of the Tate, this great temple of art will work much as cathedrals did in the age of faith: a gathering of workaday buildings for those who toiled, spun and changed money around the walls of the dominant temple. Once the cathedrals dominated our cities, then, in the age of industry, it was the railway stations, now it is the art galleries and museums.

According to the mellifluously titled Assessing the Economic Impact of the Tate Gallery of Modern Art at Bankside (1994) - prepared, says the Tate,""with pro bono help"" from McKinsey & Company - the ""Tate's development at Bankside has the potential to bring direct economic benefits to London of between £50m and £90m a year and will create 2,400 new jobs"". It may well do more than this.

In short, if one can possibly use such a word where this enormous £134m gallery is concerned, Tate Modern is very impressive and will undoubtedly be a major success. What it does not do, however, is move the heart. This is not an emotional building such as, say, the Guggenheims: Frank Lloyd Wright's in Manhattan, Frank Gehry's in Bilbao. Wilful and even downright eccentric buildings, they are both rightly acclaimed, and designed around central cores or hearts. Galleries spin off from these emotional hubs. Theirs is an architecture in the round.

By contrast, Tate Modern is linear, masculine and, if not without a powerful guiding spirit, literally heartless. This doesn't make it better or worse than the Guggenheims, just different. It is certainly a much bigger building than either, with masses of display space and a glorious collection of sometimes beautiful, sometimes provocative and sometimes irritating artworks.

What shines through is the close, intelligent and trusting relationship between client and architects. Herzog & de Meuron have been a perfect match for the dreams and ambition of Serota and his team. They knew what they wanted the Tate's giant offspring to be, got the right architects, and stood by them. When the going got tough, there was no running for cover or taking soft options. And out of it comes great architecture, whether warm or cool, whether ruled by heart or by the head. Tate Modern is truly heady stuff.

Curated by Deyan Sudjic, architecture critic of the Observer and editor of the Italian design magazine Domus, the show spins elegantly through the magnificent former rope-works of the Venice Arsenale. Rebuilt between 1579 and 1585 after designs by Antonio Da Ponte, who also designed the Rialto Bridge, the building is about the same length as the QE2.

John Pawson's graceful exhibition design makes no attempt to outdo this sublime monument to erstwhile Venetian sea-power. Yet the future buildings vying for attention beneath its great oak roofs are, for the most part, bombastic, show-off things designed, it seems, to prove that even the best architectural endeavour today is part and parcel of an aggressive and increasingly homogenised global commercial culture. If this is the future - giant shopping malls, brave new world office complexes, masterplans for cities that make the Speer-Hitler vision for a new Berlin look like so much kinderspiel - many of us will want to jump the Venetian ship and head for undeveloped shores as fast as technology can take us.

Sudjic presents this concrete cornucopia in a quiet and resolute fashion. He makes no claims for its rightness or wrongness, although it is clear that this is the best he has uncovered in his worldwide trawl of grand new architectural projects. The big names - Piano, Hadid, Chipperfield, Libeskind - are all included, apparently seduced into this vision of architecture seen from the perspective of the global airport lounge, cocktail bar and swish hotel. It is an exclusive view: the endeavours of developing countries are all but invisible. And even when they are on display, some look familiar. In the case of China, what we see in the Arsenale are designs for buildings in the shadow of the Great Wall: exquisite, experimental private housing for the newly rich.

Next is the tail that wags the long-established Venice Architecture Biennale, held in that curious zoo of national pavilions in the Giardini di Castello. Here, it is possible to see not just what the first world is up to, but how architects are responding to opportunities and problems in some of the most down-at-heel segments of the globe. In the Brazilian pavilion, for example, you get a feel for the work of Latin American architects who are trying, as best they can, to bring their professional discipline into the unplanned and all but lawless world of the favelas - the shantytowns - of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. For all their flaws, the favelas are shot through with a zest for life, conspicuously missing in the highly designed yet sanitised shopping malls and hermetic offices presented in the Arsenale.

Nobody in their right mind would choose a shack in a favela over one of the dream homes being built in the shadow of the Great Wall. Yet, as Next clearly shows, we are in danger of designing a decadent, disinfected world lacking the soul of some of the poorest parts of cities in developing countries. Or, of course, of Venice itself. With its shoulder-wide alleys, stink of sewage, rampant vice and corrupt politics, la Serenissima, was, in her imperial heyday, not unlike a monument-strewn favela. Today the city looks like it is hosting a gigantic leisurewear convention fed on ice-cream and badly cooked pasta. Sanitised for global consumption, Venice is the city as theme park.

Back in the Giardini di Castello, visitors to the Swiss pavilion were required, in the interests of cleanliness, to wear plastic overshoes. Was this a joke, a comment on Swiss fastidiousness? Perhaps, perhaps not. It was, however, a relief to visit the grubby shed at the Arsenale given over to the latest work by the Swiss architect, Peter Zumthor, who created the sublime Thermal Baths at Vals. Zumthor's craft-based designsinclude a thumping 1:10 scale concrete model of the new Kolumba Diocesan Museum in Cologne.

Significantly, Zumthor's contribution stands apart from the main body of Next. Here is an architect for whom matters of the spirit are not yet extinct.

The housing section of Next is devoted to homes for the very wealthy. These range from the sublime (a glass penthouse by Tadao Ando shot high through an ornate 1920s Manhattan skyscraper) to the utterly ridiculous (the ostentatious Millennium House at Doha designed by Arata Isozaki for Sheikh Saud, chairman of Qatar's National Councol of Culture). A contemporary domestic gesamtkunstwerk, it boasts rooms designed by the likes of Ron Arad, John Pawson and Marc Newson. The swimming pool is by David Hockney. A Disneyland model of the house features a garden animated by horses, elks, a peacock and a kangaroo, which pretty much sums up the project.

In other sections of Next we learn that the up-and-coming generation of new museums are strutting peacocks, too. No one can carp at the technical achievements these buildings represent, but a museum built entirely of glass (The Glass Museum, Toledo, Ohio by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa), another in the guise of a giant amplifier crossing a river (a museum of immigration in Mexico City designed by LCL Laboratory), and a third, the Hellenic World Museum, Athens by Anamorphosis Architects (a great swirly thing drowned under a wave-like roof), seem, at best, gratuitous.

A new wave of airport buildings and colleges seems equally over-the-top, as if architects are still playing immaturely with computers and trying to outdo one another with outlandish shapes rather than contributing to civilisation. In one fairground-like section of the exhibition, visitors walk through stalls piled high with cartoon-like skyscrapers: brightly lit, big-willy things that are, I think, meant to be funny.

Tellingly, a gallery devoted to ""work"" is a fraction of the size of the one for ""shopping"". The latter offers no alternatives to mega-shopping schemes as we plumb the shallows of retail madness. No new forms of street market. Just more and more shiny shops - such as the outlandish Selfridges branch planned for Birmingham, designed by Future Systems.

A few truly thoughtful projects emerge from this compelling global architectural fashion show. Even those allergic to visitors' centres will find some beauty in the models of the Stonehenge Visitor Centre. Designed by Denton Corker Marshall, this future building looks like a series of bow-shaped planes slid into the Wiltshire landscape. It is all but invisible, the architects' ego contained by the need to respect the haunting majesty of Stonehenge itself. If only shopping malls could be buried underground (10,000ft, say), so much the better.

Another thoughtful, practical and elegant design is that by the engineer Frei Otto and the architects Ingenhoven, Overdiek, Kahlen and Partner, for the extension and renovation of Stuttgart station (a monumental design from the 1920s by Paul Bonatz) and the district it stands in. Tracks are covered by a shell-type concrete roof that will support a cafe-fringed park. This is a ""zero energy"" project, say the designers - which comes as a relief after the sight of so many potentially energy-guzzling monsters elsewhere in the Arsenale.

The cocksure architecture on show at Next - a heaven for architects, their clients and fans - is in danger of creating a couture hell on earth for the rest of us. It really is time to think: what next?

There was a breathless hush - and stifled yawns. Was this really it? The architect was smooth-talking, but as I looked around, the mood of photographers, cameramen and journalists said it all. It might well do the job, but its design seemed almost wilfully lacklustre.

In dramatic contrast, the main stadium for this year's Beijing Olympics is, quite simply, stunning. Here is an adventure in steel and concrete, a building - despite its age-old purpose - like no other. Its structure is very nearly complete, while the fit-out, with its plethora of shops, restaurants, cafes, bars and meeting places, is racing ahead. At times, there have been as many as 7,000 construction workers on site, yet this is no rush job. It is a work of exceptional quality.

If China has set out to impress the world with the 2008 Olympics, the stadium and its attendant buildings - the Aquatics Centre and Digital Beijing (the Olympics ""command post"") - have set a heady precedent. The furtive London Olympics, with its glum building site hidden behind what can only ever be known as the Great Wall of Stratford, will struggle to match the design standards set by the Chinese, although Zaha Hadid and her wave-like swimming pool offer a ray of hope for the London event.

At the moment, although the Beijing stadium can be seen from the long avenues flanking the Olympic Park, access is barred to all but the most determined. Guards in thick green army coats and fur hats patrol the gate, while workers - from the far-flung provinces, mostly, and earning about £3 a day - troop in and out. Inside the compound where the stadium sits, its structure now complete, men stand on high-level walkways brandishing welding guns. Others balance precariously from the steelwork; at least 10 are said to have fallen and died here.

An eye-catching design even from a distance, the stadium proves to be a mind-bogglingly complex artefact as you get up close, and it is just as dizzying on the inside. The Chinese named it the Bird's Nest as soon as its creators - Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, working with Arup and the China Architectural Design and Research Group - unveiled their design five years ago. It measures 320 metres by 297 metres, and is 69 metres high. Its mesmeric steel frame, 41,875 tonnes in all, loops, swoops and swirls over and around the great, red, concrete 91,000-seat arena. What had seemed to be a solid structure from a distance proves to be a filigree Chinese puzzle close up.

Jacques Herzog has described this 12-metre-deep frame as ""an architectural forest"", its beams, stairs, frames and other steel elements standing in for trees and branches, and providing an awe-inspiring transitional space between the exterior, the Olympic Park, and the interior, where the arena awaits. The latter, a great, red bowl of concrete, proves to be almost circular, so everyone is equally close to the running-jumping-vaulting action. This makes it just that bit different from other ambitious stadiums, such as Wembley, and it does feel that bit more of a piece, streamlined even. Above the tiers of plastic seats and confident-looking clocks, the roof is a simple membrane designed to keep out sun and storm (the Olympics take place in August, when Beijing is hot and thundery) and to act as a foil to that intricate steel skeleton.

When the Games are over, the stadium will host sporting and cultural events, as well as rock concerts and those ineffable flag-waving parades so beloved of the Chinese. By then, the stadium will sit comfortably in landscaped gardens, also designed by Herzog & de Meuron, intended to be contemporary plays on traditional Chinese themes. If all goes to plan, the Olympic Park might yet turn out to be an Unforbidden City, a people's palace gardens of the future.

Not everyone likes the Bird's Nest, though - least of all Beijing artist Ai Weiwei, whom Herzog & de Meuron persuaded to work on the design. Ai Weiwei, who once smashed a 2,000-year-old Han dynasty vase to make a decidedly iconoclastic point about Chinese art, and who, in 2000, curated a highly controversial art show in Shanghai entitled Fuck Off, was raised in a labour camp in Xinjiang province. In the 1950s, his father Ai Qing, one of China's most celebrated modern poets, was denounced as ""an enemy of the state and a rightist"". Ai Weiwei tends to speak his mind, even in a country that still frowns on free expression. He likens the 2008 Olympics to ""a pretend smile"" and, although he believes the stadium to be beautiful, he also calls it a ""public relations sham"" hiding the true political nature of China. His stance serves as a reminder that this global sporting event has not always gone hand-in-hand with polite politics and international camaraderie, however great its architecture and athletes.

The Bird's Nest sits near the second of the major Beijing Olympic venues, the Water Cube; or, to give it its official name, the National Aquatics Centre. This magical structure - designed by Australian architects PTW with Arup, the Shenzen Design Institute and the China State Construction and Engineering Corporation - has just opened and is already hosting a Chinese swimming competition.

In essence, the Water Cube is a big, £50m steel and concrete box containing a huge swimming pool flanked by 17,000 seats. But what an extraordinary box it is. The pattern of the structure has been designed to hold huge pillows of ETFE, a lightweight substitute for glass, the same inflated hi-tech material used to clad the domes of Cornwall's Eden Centre. The pattern is based on the natural formation of soap bubbles to give a random, organic appearance.

It was clearly clever, not to mention fun, to make a big box into an architectural and engineering conjuring trick. Yet this is also a responsible design; the pillows heat up in the sun, and this in turn heats the water in the pool and feeds into the rest of the building. It is exceedingly efficient. In the evening, as an added bonus, the Water Cube glows a happy, swimming pool blue; it looks great from the street, one of those buildings you feel compelled to go and have a look at.

The last of the three major Olympic buildings was designed by Zhu Pei, a Beijing architect trained in the US as well as China. This is Digital Beijing, the control and data centre for the Games, scheduled to become a museum and exhibition centre for digital design and technologies and, apparently, a communications hub for the city. Zhu's design, in stark contrast to the stadium, is a sequence of tall buildings that look, on first encounter, rather like upright 1960s IBM computers.

What makes it a delight, as you get up close, is Zhu's creative use of unexpected materials. A special fibre he developed with a Chinese manufacturer will be used for floors in the building, and is ideally suited for the projection of ever-changing digital images. Equally, the material is strong enough to be used for sci-fi-style pedestrian bridges within the building. As for the oddly gleaming end walls of the pavilion, these are composed of aluminium sheets made to look, strangely, like stone. The technique was developed by a Chinese tin can manufacturer. Ingenious - and the result is delightful.

Zhu is one of a number of Chinese architects who have been able to set up their own studios freely in recent years, and who are keen to invent and develop a modern Chinese architecture that plays with, rather than mimics, tradition, one that is as independent as it wishes to be from contemporary western practice. The great luxury Zhu has enjoyed with the Olympic project is time. Most modern Chinese architecture is raced up as fast and as cheaply as possible, leaving precious little time for original thought or craftsmanship. Yet the three major Olympic buildings have been almost five years in the making.

And they are not just for the summer Games. Each has something to offer a new, specifically Chinese architecture that might yet emerge - against the political and economic odds - in the coming years. For this alone, each deserves a gold medal, though the spellbinding Bird's Nest deserves a special award of its own. The designs will be on show at the V&A's China Design Now exhibition, opening in London next month, but nothing quite prepares you for the reality. Herzog & de Meuron, along with an army of Chinese workers, have conjured a truly Olympian design.

Parliament View, an apartment block by Lambeth Bridge in London, is absolutely inexcusable. If you got a bit of cardboard and bent it to a curve, it would wrinkle and look ugly - and that's precisely the effect created here. You can imagine the architects and planners saying: ""Curved buildings are really sexy - let's make one, but really cheaply."" The detailing looks like something a primary school would come up with - rather tragic given that this country was responsible for the arts and crafts movement, which created buildings with the resources available and detailed them with humanity. This is the architectural equivalent of someone scratching a blackboard with their fingernails. It's like one of the worst Changing Room makeovers ever. What worries me is the taste-free dullards who have bought apartments here. I'd rather see the Elephant and Castle shopping centre preserved for posterity.

The Royal Naval College at Greenwich, by contrast, is all about detailing and humanity. Everything seems to be at eye level; it's not patronising or distant in the way that Parliament View is. Every last detail is considered. There are buildings that sex me up more, but it is the most important building in London for me, the reason I moved to Greenwich. It says something, I think, about British democracy that this is the only true palace in London, and was ultimately used not by the royal family, but as a hospital for distressed and diseased seamen. It wasn't really finished until the 19th century, and you can see the handwriting of so many great British architects on it: Wren, Hawksmoor, Vanbrugh. It's emblematic of the best of British architecture, which grows and develops over time.

He tumbled two stories, severely breaking his leg.

His employer did not call an ambulance. Instead, a co-worker drove the Brockton High School freshman 75 miles in an old work van, across state lines, to a hospital in Massachusetts. As they crawled through rush-hour traffic, Mayancela had no idea his boss would try to dodge responsibility for the accident.

“I couldn’t breathe, much less talk,” recalled Mayancela, an Ecuadoran who took the job in 2013 to help support his family. “It’s pain you don’t forget.”

He is one of thousands of immigrants, many undocumented, helping meet the demand for workers in the region’s booming construction industry. They haul slabs of sheetrock and climb rooftops and dusty scaffolds, doing often dangerous work for contractors seeking cheap labor.

A Globe investigation found that these workers, eager for a paycheck, are often paid below the prevailing wage and illegally, in cash. They are also the most likely to be subjected to unsafe work conditions, without insurance to cover medical bills or lost pay if they get hurt. And the unscrupulous contractors who employ them are too seldom caught and penalized.

“This is not about catching a few bad actors that are dragging down the industry,’’ said Diego Low, director of the Metrowest Worker Center in Framingham, which helps workers fight for fair wages and safety. “We’ve evolved a system for providing subsidized labor to build our houses, and it’s based on the vulnerability of the workforce.”

Federal officials identified 910 “willful or repeat violations” that involved hospitalizations or deaths in the Massachusetts construction industry over the past three years, according to public records requested from the US Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Of those, 98 percent took place on jobs run by nonunion contractors, OSHA said.

The real number of injuries is likely higher, advocates and government officials said, because undocumented workers on these job sites often are pressured not to report accidents.

Interviews with more than three dozen construction workers, legal advocates, and regulators, as well as construction site visits and the review of hundreds of pages of records, reveal industry practices that routinely exploit immigrant workers. They also point to companies that are repeat offenders, undercutting legitimate contractors who play by the rules.

Sometimes the victims are minors, or young men barely in their 20s.

Among the personal stories uncovered by the Globe:

■ A 23-year-old roofer from Ecuador shattered his collarbone after falling from a 32-foot ladder in Waltham during Christmas week in 2014. His employer told him to drive himself home, even though he had been briefly knocked unconscious. It took five days for him to get medical care, and a year-and-a-half before receiving the surgery he needed to repair the break.

■ A dozen immigrant workers repeatedly sought a combined $150,000 in back wages from a New Hampshire drywaller who, they said, threatened not to pay them if they quit. When they finally made plans to leave, he left a profanity-laced voicemail on the phone of one of the workers.

■ A former Boston restaurateur-turned-contractor routinely failed to pay immigrant construction workers, even after they traveled to his home to complain and court judgments were entered against him.

“We know these workers are particularly susceptible to abuse,’’ Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in an interview. “They switch locations; they switch bosses regularly. By the time they complain to us, or we become aware of it, the bad actors may be long gone from the scene.”

Plenty of US citizens and documented workers get hurt in construction, too. But undocumented immigrants, deeply woven into the fabric of the economy in ways often overlooked by the public and political candidates, face additional struggles.

Isidoro Peralta fell from a 32-foot ladder while working in Waltham. His broken collarbone healed improperly, and he had to fight for medical care for a year-and-a-half before having corrective surgery at Boston Medical Center.

Many do not speak English and are unfamiliar with federal and state labor laws, which require employers to pay them at least minimum wage and carry workers’ compensation. These workers are often improperly characterized as independent contractors by employers who want to avoid paying their insurance and payroll taxes.

“There’s no contractual obligation between the employer and their workers,’’ said Marcy Goldstein-Gelb, longtime executive director of the Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health, who was recently promoted to run the national organization. “There’s no written agreement that if they speak up about health and safety, that they still have a job.”

When injured, these workers can get lost in medical limbo. If they tell doctors they were hurt on a work site but have no pay stubs or documentation to prove who their employer is, it can be next to impossible to get care, according to lawyers, advocates, and regulators.

That’s what happened to a 16-year-old Guatemalan youth, nicknamed Baby, on the work sites of a Lynn contractor. He plunged to the ground last fall from a ladder while lugging too much wood for his 118-pound frame.

His employer dropped him off at home that night instead of taking him to a doctor, according to the boy’s account to the Globe, his lawyer, and advocates. He was for months declined medical care because he had no legal guardian and no employer offering to pay his insurance, his lawyer said.

In another case, Isidoro Peralta, the Ecuadoran roofer, had to fight for medical care for a year-and-a-half after falling from a ladder in Waltham. While he waited, his collarbone healed improperly and he could no longer lift weight with his right arm. He was out of work, without pay, and in pain.

When Peralta talked to his employer at AN Construction, “Nothing happened,” he said.

Indeed, his boss, Angel Namina, denied to his insurer that Peralta was hurt on the job, according to Peralta’s workers’ compensation claim filed with the state.

The owner of the Milford construction outfit did not answer calls to his phone and could not be reached. He has failed to pay a fine for a prior serious violation with OSHA for failing to guard against fall hazards, according to public records.

Peralta’s lawyer fought the claim denial and reached an agreement with the insurer, so Peralta could have surgery. His doctor at Boston Medical Center said he had to cut apart his clavicle and repair it. Peralta said he was warned that if the doctor missed by a quarter-inch and sliced an artery, Peralta would be at risk of dying within a minute.

“I did it,’’ said Peralta through a translator, his youthful smile covering up many months of stress. “Thank God it came out OK.”

AT LUXURY CONDOMINIUMS in Wellesley and modern apartment complexes in Chelsea, as well as building projects for colleges and major retailers, developers have been accused of looking the other way when subcontractors underpay workers and cut corners on safety.

Wage and safety violations have resulted in 1,300 complaints in the past three years just to the Massachusetts attorney general’s office. Some incidents have involved broken limbs, concussions, and wounds that went untreated for long periods because employers failed to provide the required insurance.

Many workers are urged not to say that injuries occur on a work site. Some fear losing their jobs if they complain, or worse, being exposed as undocumented, then deported.

Mayancela, who fell from the roof in Maine in the summer of 2013, was lucky in one way: He eventually received the care he needed, after being transported to Boston Children’s Hospital and later having a rod surgically placed in his femur.

Low, the Metrowest worker advocate, helped him navigate medical appointments. A Medford lawyer who specializes in such cases, Stacie Sobosik, cut through layers of subcontractors to find an employer in the chain whose insurance would pay for his coverage.

“It had nothing whatsoever to do with our company, although it dragged us through the mud for a while,’’ said King Weinstein, the Old Orchard Beach, Maine-based general contractor at the house where Mayancela fell. He said his firm ran its usual checks on the Massachusetts roofing subcontractor, Force Corp., and confirmed it had liability insurance and workers’ comp coverage at the time it was hired.

But those checks did not turn up problems at Force or with its general manager, Juliano Teles Fernandes.

Mayancela was receiving pay on the Portland job from Twin Pines Construction Inc., a company owned by Fernandes.

He and companies he has owned or managed have been cited for more than 100 violations since 2007, by federal safety regulators, including some that endangered workers’ lives, according to public records.

Over his career, Fernandes has racked up obligations and fines of $1.5 million with OSHA that have not been paid. The US attorney’s office in Boston is suing to collect those.

Fernandes and his Twin Pines firm were cited by the agency in May 2013 for serious and willful violations. That June, Fernandes let his workers’ comp policy lapse, according to public records. A month later, Mayancela fell from makeshift scaffolding in Maine.

Fernandes would claim to OSHA investigators that yet another subcontractor was the teen’s employer. But if there was such an assignment, it was informal and did not relieve Fernandes of his responsibility. The insurer for the other subcontractor — the same as Force’s — ultimately covered the claim. Force, which has had offices in Woburn, Clinton, and Lunenburg, was cited by OSHA in the Mayancela case for having a child under age 16 do hazardous construction work and for failing to keep proper date-of-birth records.

It’s illegal in Maine to hire anyone under age 18 for roofing. Yet the fine was modest: $15,350.

Omar Pedroza installed drywall at an East Boston apartment project. As a job foreman, he said he sometimes had to stuff cash from a subcontractor into his pockets to pay co-workers.

Meanwhile, even the serious injury of a 15-year-old and a string of fines didn’t move Force or Fernandes to change their ways. Last December, Force was sanctioned yet again, for exposing roofers to potentially fatal fall hazards, and for what OSHA called “unacceptable behavior that must change before a worker’s life or career is destroyed.’’

Fernandes could not be located at his listed addresses and declined to comment through a spokeswoman. This summer, federal authorities reached a settlement with Force to pay $2.4 million in back wages and damages to 478 workers for “willful” violations.

Force, in a statement at the time, said, “We take our commitment to our employees seriously and have cooperated fully with the DOL in its review, and are pleased to have resolved this issue in the best interest of our employees.”

Force also said, in response to Globe inquiries, that it is now requiring more safety training for workers and is “actively monitoring all job sites” for compliance. “We now better understand how critical it is to provide OSHA with feedback and contest findings in real time.”

STACIE SOBOSIK, the Medford attorney who represents injured workers, said the most frustrating part of these cases is how general contractors persist, even after egregious workplace violations, in hiring abusive subcontractors.

“They don’t care. They’re going to keep using this company because they’re cheap labor,’’ Sobosik said. “There’s a reason that they’re so inexpensive compared to the market,’’ she said. “It doesn’t come free, that discount.”

Force recently landed a job working on a new 447-unit development at Somerville’s Assembly Row. The contractor that hired the company is Callahan Construction Managers, a Bridgewater company that has managed several of the largest residential projects in the Boston area in recent years.

Callahan, unlike Boston’s downtown commercial developers, often hires nonunion labor. The firm has been criticized by public officials in Quincy and Cambridge for allegedly failing to thoroughly vet its subcontractors.

The company’s president, Pat Callahan, said in a statement that when he hired Force, he was unaware of its issues with the Labor Department and OSHA.

“Since these matters came to light, Callahan has employed a stringent workforce monitoring process, and we are enforcing the right to inspect payroll records,’’ he said in the statement. “In the meantime, we are confident in the work Force Corp. is performing at Assembly Row.”

General contractors bid on multimillion-dollar jobs and divvy up the work to a thicket of smaller firms. It has proven notoriously difficult for authorities to police those subcontractors, according to regulators in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.

“People, when they cheat the system, recognize big cost savings,” said Rudolph Ogden, an attorney for New Hampshire’s Department of Labor. He said the state is working to crack down on employers who break the law, but, “A lot of times we only hear when people stop getting paid. Or get hurt.”

JUAN GONZALEZ, a 36-year-old from Mexico, worked for Yankee Drywall Corp. in Hudson, N.H., for nearly 15 years. His father, nephew, and cousin worked there too. He put up with the company’s difficult owners, he said, because the money was good. He started at $26 per hour and worked his way up to $33, and made enough to send some home to his mother.

“I love what I do,’’ Gonzalez said. “Create something. You can be proud.”

The company is owned by Gerald “Gerry” Crete, a gruff 59-year-old who runs the business with his wife, Martha Laramee, out of their home. They have a tidy yard and $50,000, his-and-hers, four-door Ford pickup trucks, black and white, in the driveway.

There would be weeks the workers were paid, followed by missed weeks, then promises of catching up. By late last year, Yankee allegedly owed more than $150,000 to a dozen workers, including Gonzalez and his family members.

“They used to tell us, ‘If you leave, I’m not going to give you the money. So you’ve got to show up for work tomorrow,’ ” said Iran Gonzalez, Juan’s cousin.

In late December, Juan Gonzalez received an angry voicemail from Crete, peppered with expletives, pleading with him and the other workers to return, and promising they would be paid. But the Gonzalez family had had enough: This time, they took their complaints to the authorities.

“You have to be a tough guy in this business,’’ Crete said during an interview in the couple’s kitchen in March. He called the industry “crooked,” and bitterly blamed missed payments to his crew on contractors who, he said, owed him money.

He said he owed the men no more than $5,000 each in back pay. But Juan Gonzalez said he alone is owed more than $20,000.

“I’m broke,’’ Crete said. He claimed to have filed for bankruptcy protection, but there were no such records in federal court in New Hampshire.

In April, Attorney General Healey’s office investigated and cited the company and Crete $26,000 for intentionally failing to pay employees and misclassifying them as independent contractors to avoid paying benefits and workers’ compensation.

Crete failed to respond to the AG’s demand for records, according to Healey spokeswoman Jillian Fennimore, and allegedly ignored multiple attempts to resolve the allegations.

New Hampshire’s labor department is pursuing Yankee for $171,000 in unpaid wages plus penalties. A hearing is set on the matter for October.

Mayancela and his little brother Filemon, 14 months, spent time together at Mayancela’s Brockton home.

EVEN WHEN AUTHORITIES do catch firms breaking the law, it can be cheaper for employers to pay fines than follow the rules. Some firms simply skip town and open under a new name.

Of the 1,300 complaints to the Massachusetts attorney general over the past three years, the office issued 455 citations against construction employers, sometimes multiple times, seeking restitution totaling $2.4 million and nearly $1 million in penalties, according to public records requests.

But companies often fail to pay even small sums. Healey’s office has collected just one-third of the $1.7 million in violations since January 2015, or $580,234. The bulk of the rest is under appeal or past due.

The AG’s office can’t readily say how much it collected prior to 2015, because the records were not computerized.

In Massachusetts, workers have to navigate a number of agencies to complain about employers who break the law. Neither the attorney general nor OSHA can easily shut down a company, even if it has multiple violations against it. The state Department of Industrial Accidents can issue stop-work orders when its investigators find companies not paying for workers’ compensation.

Governor Charlie Baker and Deval Patrick before him have heard the complaints of union executives that firms paying in the low $20s per hour or less, without overtime or insurance, are unfair competition. The residential union construction rate in Boston, including insurance and benefits, is $45 per hour, according to the New England Regional Council of Carpenters.

“This is wage theft,’’ said Manny Gines, an organizer for the union, who travels the Northeast helping workers and confronting companies that are breaking wage laws. “We really can’t compete with them if they’re not getting paid.”

THE RECENTLY COMPLETED One North of Boston complex in Chelsea, a $110 million project with some 450 apartments, boasts luxury studios for $1,735 a month and two-bedrooms for $2,390. There are yoga and spin studios, an indoor basketball court, and doggie day care.

The general contractor was Callahan, the Bridgewater company. On one visit by the Globe, Universal Drywall of Auburn, N.H., had about 30 workers framing and building walls at the massive property; only a handful were marked as employees on sign-in sheets.

The rest were classified as subcontractors — the same practice the attorney general challenged when it sued Universal in 2014, alleging a “pattern of unfair competition” on the Chelsea job because it did not pay workers as employees. That case is ongoing, according to the AG’s office.

Omar Pedroza, an ex-foreman on the site, was asked to illegally distribute cash wages to the workers, he told the Globe and his legal advocates. He sometimes had to drive long distances to pick up money from a Universal subcontractor he was working for, stuffing some $5,000 in cash into his pockets to distribute to workers.

A lawyer for Universal, Simon C. Leeming, said in a statement, “Universal has never paid an employee in cash, never.” If employees received cash, he said, it was done by a subcontractor. He said the company’s subcontractors are required to comply with the law.

In a March letter responding to a Globe inquiry, Callahan’s financial chief, Dennis Sheehan, said, “We take these matters very seriously and will conduct an investigation.’’ He also said, “We go to great lengths to screen and monitor our subcontractors at all levels.”

After the alleged issues in Chelsea, Callahan decided not to use Universal as a subcontractor on its Marina Bay residential project now underway in Quincy, spokeswoman Lisa Nickerson said. Universal is still working for Callahan on other jobs.

LAST FALL, CONSTRUCTION workers and organizers chanted Callahan’s name in downtown Wellesley, outside luxury condos called the Belclare, on behalf of a worker who wasn’t being paid.

Callahan representatives said the company has been unfairly targeted by union advocates, and that it had taken over the Belclare job from another firm, and so was not responsible for hiring the subcontractors.

One of those subs was William Ashmore, a former owner of Stoddard’s pub in downtown Boston. A group of workers went looking for Ashmore on Cape Cod to get paid, to no avail. Three sued him in small claims court, alleging he owed them thousands of dollars. But he failed to show up in court, even after promising at a New Bedford worker center meeting to pay the men.

Finally, the court issued a warrant for his arrest.

“I had every plan to deal with it,’’ Ashmore said. Some instances were misunderstandings, he said, or a failure by workers to provide accurate addresses. Once, he said, another firm should have paid the workers.

“I’m a little fish,” Ashmore said, “in a very, very big sea of monsters.”","Luis Mayancela was just 15 years old when he fell from the roof of a house in Portland, Maine, where he was helping fasten shingles, tumbling two stories and severely breaking his leg.",110.5945945946,0.9729729730000001,15.4054054054,high,high,extractive,architecture

It was dismantled in 1930, but a group of fans wanted it reconstructed, and architects, commissioned by the city, rebuilt it between 1983 and 1986. It is now on its original site in Montjuic.

Mies combined ""primordial"" materials such as green marble from Greece, onyx from the Atlas mountains, even pools of water, with modern materials like steel and plate glass. He choreographed vertical and horizontal planes to create a kind of sensory overload of transparency and reflection, of patterned surfaces and floating perspectives. The building has a strict rectangular geometry, but its low-slung, metal structure has a natural rhythm. It never feels like a box; every space is open ended. It is not just a modernist icon, I think it is also one of the greatest sculptures of the 20th century.

Blunder: Ikea offices and store

Ikea make great, modernist-inspired design accessible to thousands of people. We love their products - so what went wrong with their buildings? Their headquarters and store at Brent Cross in London are breathtakingly ugly. A neomodernist towerblock squats at the edge of the motorway. It is decked out in a tawdry, plastic coating of blue and yellow, with narrow strips of dirty windows that look as if they've got something to hide. The store is typical of strip mall developments - an enormous shed with a logo stuck on. And the whole thing swims in a sea of cars. Wouldn't it be great if, as well as pioneering good design, they could pioneer great architecture?

(AAP)

At least seventeen people have been killed and three remain under the rubble after a residential building in Egypt's capital collapsed.

Countless buildings in the teeming city of more than 20 million have been put up in defiance of the most elementary rules of construction, often without permission, rescue services say.

The owners had illegally added two additional floors to the seven-storey building in the poor Matariya district in the east of the city.

""Seventeen people have been killed, eight injured and three are still under the rubble according to their relatives,"" Cairo's emergency services head General Mamduh Abdelkader told AFP on Tuesday.

He said the cause of the collapse was still being investigated but illegal construction work was suspected.

""We don't yet know the cause of the accident but we have been told that two storeys were recently added totally illegally,"" Abdelkader said.

Relatives of the missing and onlookers were digging with their bare hands in the rubble.

A woman who said her brother died in the collapse charged that the building was so unsafe she had refused to enter it.

""When I would come to see my brother I refused to come inside because the building was too fragile. I told my brother and all inhabitants they had to leave,"" she said.

Mohammed al-Bishlawy, district prosecutor for eastern Cairo, told AFP he has opened an inquiry and asked for the arrest of the building's owner.

He blamed the accident on ""renovation work in a second-floor apartment that has affected the structure of the building and the addition of two floors without permission"".

There have been several deadly building collapses in the past few years in Egypt, where safety and planning regulations are widely flouted.

Landlords often add extra floors to buildings whose foundations were not designed to support them.

Sharp Chief Executive Kozo Takahashi has been in negotiations with the firm's main lenders, Mizuho Financial Group, Mizuho Bank and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, for the company's second major bailout since 2012, people familiar with the matter have said.

The firm's banks agreed in September 2012 to provide Sharp with loans and credit lines worth 360 billion yen, or $3 billion at today's exchange rates, in exchange for promises to return to profit by this year. So far, it has exited the European TV market and closed solar-panel businesses in Europe and the United States.

One person familiar with the matter previously said Sharp has also asked Japan Industrial Solutions, a corporate turnaround fund, to invest up to $250 million in capital.

The Nikkei reported earlier on Thursday that Sharp could also shed its North American television business and lower the pay scale for workers in Japan. The Yomiuri newspaper reported Sharp was considering closing its TV factory in Mexico and cutting the size of its North American sales division.

. And as the country began to claw its way out of the economic muck, the BLS had the highest recovery hopes for this goods-producing industry. In its last

, released in February 2012, the BLS predicted numerous construction jobs among the fastest-growing from 2010 to 2020. It was one of the most off-the-mark predictions the government agency made, however.Growth in this sector has been evident, but far from fast. The estimated unemployment rate for construction slid from a chilling 20.6 percent in 2010 to 16.4 percent in 2011, and 13.9 percent in 2012. All construction jobs are subject to the fluctuations of the economy, and as yet, our economy is still grasping for footing. The construction workers who are finding work are those with experience.

Fortunately, our U.S. News Best Construction Jobs aren't simply based on employment projections, but also on actual unemployment rates, salaries, good job prospects, plus advancement possibilities, low stress and a steady work-life balance. Here are the 10 jobs we picked, where the odds of finding a job could be in your favor.

There's a myth that every construction job involves manual labor -- not true. A cost estimator does occasionally don a hard hat and get his or her hands dirty on a construction site, but he or she also spends considerable time crunching numbers in a sterile office. Cost estimators are involved in both high-level and minuscule decisions of budgeting, and so they must remain familiar with a site's resources but also be adept with computers and various estimating software. Some cost estimators are charged with budgeting the cost of a project from start to finish, while others are hired to budget specifics, like the electrical component. A bachelor's degree in an industry-related field is the most common starting point, but voluntarily pursuing certification will give you even more of an edge. The BLS predicts that those with knowledge of Building Information Modeling software should have the strongest chances.

Fairbanks, Alaska, Santa Barbara, Calif., and Framingham, Mass., pay estimators the highest salaries, according to the BLS.

There's also a myth that those who work in a blue-collar industry don't earn a lot of green. This occupation disproves that. In 2011, construction managers' average salary was just shy of $95,000, putting them in a higher pay bracket than some computer systems analysts and civil engineers. To become the professional responsible for planning and budgeting a construction project, you'll most likely need a bachelor's degree in construction science, building science, or a related field. An associate's degree, when married with relevant experience, could also serve as an appropriate entry. Other crucial traits for a construction manager include: analytical skills for troubleshooting project snags; some managerial experience so you can be adept at finding and supervising staff; and strong communication skills for writing proposals and budget plans. Population growth and heightened demand for more office buildings, hospitals and infrastructure should elevate job prospects for those qualified.

In 2011, New York state had one of the highest employment levels for this occupation, plus it also paid its managers well: The metropolitan areas of Elmira, Nassau, and New York City all report average salaries of at least $135,000 to the BLS.

It's the troubleshooting component of a plumber's duties that most of us are familiar with, but there's so much more to this job. After a four- to five-year apprenticeship, plumbers are versed in blueprints and building codes and have the know-how to install, maintain, and repair water and drainage pipes for small appliances, as well as large septic systems. Employment demand in this field is spurred by a few factors: new building construction, the installation of more-efficient, low-flow plumbing systems, and a vast number of boomer plumbers who are expected to retire soon.

Densely populated states like Texas, California, and New York are among those with the highest employment level of plumbers, but some of the top-paying metropolitan areas for this field might surprise you: The BLS reports that Vineland, N.J., Peabody, Mass., and Madison, Wis., compensate plumbers especially well.

In this profession, you absolutely cannot be afraid of heights: glaziers cut, install, fasten, seal and remove glass for windows, skylights and storefronts. And it also helps to be multifaceted, since the BLS reports that employers prefer glaziers who can handle a range of tasks. The majority of those currently employed are working in foundation, structure, and building exteriors, but new commercial construction and the need to retrofit and repair existing structures could drive hiring demand for indoor projects as well.

If previous hiring trends are any indication, you'll want to look west: California, Texas and Washington have some of the highest levels of employment, plus the metropolitan areas of San Jose, Calif., and Oakland, Calif., tend to pay particularly well.

Concrete is a common foundation for many construction projects, and using it involves installing rebar and other reinforcing materials, pouring a cement mixture, spreading and leveling that mixture, monitoring its hardening, and applying sealants. Like other construction workers, cement masons and concrete finishers learn their trade during a formal apprenticeship, but those who also take masonry-related courses should experience the best job opportunities, according to the BLS.

Although work in this industry is often dependent on dry, warm weather, the top-paying metropolitan areas are northern locales: Nassau, N.Y., Fairbanks, Alaska, and Bloomington, Ill., each paid average salaries that were higher than $75,000 in 2011.

One plus to painting is that those with limited or no experience could find work. The basic qualifications to wield your first brush are a minimum age of 18, a high school diploma or GED, and the physical ability to do the work. But the greenest painters could face tough competition finding -- and keeping -- employment when competing with union workers who have completed a three- or four-year apprenticeship program and have become certified. If you're hoping to make painting a career, it's prudent to begin an apprenticeship where you'll receive both technical training and practical experience.

In 2011, the BLS noted that the states that employed the most painters were California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas. Illinois also shelters the best-paid in the field. In 2011, the average annual wage for a painter in the Kankakee, Ill., area was $69,880.

Brick and stone exteriors are expensive but they still remain popular building materials due to their durability. As the economy and housing market rebounds, new buildings should be erected that use these materials and require the skilled masons to lay them. Older brick buildings will need repair. For these reasons, the BLS predicts that employment for brickmasons and blockmasons could balloon 40 percent before 2020. It's possible to learn some basics on the job, but studying masonry at a technical college or entering an apprenticeship are also a common training pathways. Programs usually last at least three years.

Large cities like Boston, Detroit and San Francisco compensate brickmasons and blockmasons particularly well. Although the average salary in 2011 was a little more than $50,000, according to the BLS, workers in the aforementioned cities earned more than $70,000 annually. Boston brickmasons nearly eclipsed $90,000 in 2011.

The road to becoming a Master or Journeyman Electrician is long: it starts with a high school diploma or GED, followed by a four- or five-year apprenticeship with on-the-job training and lessons in electrical theory, electrical codes and mathematics. Most states require you to pass a licensing exam before you begin working independently, and specialized training in soldering, fire alarms, and elevators might also be necessary.

The top-paying metropolitan areas for this occupation are Vallejo, Calif., New York City, and Fairbanks, Alaska.

Carpentry is one of the oldest construction professions as well as one of the most versatile. You could choose to work on a smaller scale, building frameworks for residences, or on a slightly larger scale, insulating a high-rise office building, or even on a colossal scale, fortifying trusses for bridges. Carpenters' exposure to all components of a construction project make them one of the more secure professions within the industry, although they, too, could be employment victims of the fickle economy. Those with the best employment chances have completed an apprenticeship and preferably can speak both Spanish and English.

The best-paid workers are employed in some pretty scenic places, like Honolulu, San Francisco and Santa Cruz, Calif.

The pros: With little to no experience, a general construction laborer or helper could get hired to do odd tasks on a site, and just about every construction site needs workers to assist with loading and unloading materials, making measurements, digging ditches, operating equipment, and cleanup. Now the cons: General construction laborers often don't have any formal education requirement or licensing to start work, so the spectrum of ""experience"" someone has working in this field is immense. The most seasoned and multifaceted have the best opportunities, while the rookies could get the shaft. The pay scale is also low, starting around $9 an hour in 2011, the BLS reports. But this occupation could be a great springboard into another branch of construction, and some of the time spent working under a master electrician, plumber or carpenter could count toward the practical hours needed in a skilled trades apprenticeship.

The best-paid general construction workers are employed in Massachusetts. The BLS reports that in 2011, workers in Boston, Leominster and Framingham, Mass., made at least $53,000 annually.","By Jada A.

Among the nearly one million Elvis artifacts in Graceland's collection are 6,000 items of clothing. In the fine stitchery, extravagant ornament, opulent patterns and the thrift of generic store goods, another part of the Elvis myth can be discerned. He had large feet, for instance, and until nearly the end, a teenager's narrow waist. He had linebacker shoulders and a big head, and not just as a result of the pompadour and all the adulation.

That Elvis Presley was a clothes hound is not lost on anyone remotely familiar with the late legend. Since his death on Aug. 16, 1977, the legacy of Elvis Aaron Presley as an American style setter and icon has blurred into many others, not least of which is the King as a sequined sight gag, bloated, drugged and lacquered, barricaded behind his celebrity and his wraparound shades.

Like much about Elvis, the reality tends to be more nuanced and complex. And now, after decades in storage at Graceland, which has never exhibited more than a fraction of his wardrobe, Elvis's clothes will become known to the public in ''Elvis Fashion: From Memphis to Vegas'' (Universe Publishing), a book due in early December. The book marks a change in both the cult and the culture of Elvis, opening the closets and the archives to reveal unexpected aspects of a man about whom it is easy to feel that everything is already known.

''For years, Elvis Presley Enterprises had a fortress mentality,'' said John Strausbaugh, author of ''E: Reflections on the Birth of the Elvis Faith.'' In its zeal to safeguard Elvis's image, the singer's estate may inadvertently have trapped it in the amber of misconception and false memory. The flamboyant Elvis of the studded jumpsuits was just one incarnation. There were other and more radical Elvises that, if they did not outright alter American sartorial tastes and habits, prefigured important pop cultural trends of the next 30 years.

''One of the really important ways in which he influenced fashion is that he bought his clothes at Lansky's,'' explained Ann Powers, the senior curator at the Experience Music Project in Seattle, referring to the landmark Memphis haberdashery whose clientele in the 1950's was primarily black. Ms. Powers said that Elvis was ''a white man dressing in black people's clothing,'' just as he was a white man adapting black music to his own use.

Beyond that, he was a highly singular white man who chose for himself the most extravagant of raiment, garments that, Ms. Powers suggested, flouted not merely the unwritten dress codes of segregation but migrated freely across the boundaries of sex. It was Elvis's hip swiveling, but also his pink clothes, his voluminous trousers and his eyeshadow that armed critics with what they called ''evidence'' of his power to destroy the morals of American youth.

''We did a lot of ethnic business in those days, and in the ethnic business they went into the high-fashion mohairs, the silks and wools, the purples and the chartreuse and the gold lamé,'' recalled Bernard J. Lansky, the store's proprietor, who is 77. It was Mr. Lansky who sold Elvis his famous gold lamé jacket in 1956, for the impressive sum of $125. ''Elvis was working as a movie theater usher at Loews theater, and he used to go down to the churches around town and see what the people doing the gospel music wore,'' Mr. Lansky said. ''He liked the way they operated. He knew what was happening. He was sharp.''

Indeed, the designer Tommy Hilfiger said, Elvis was ''the first white boy to really bling it up.'' He was one of the first performers of any race, Mr. Hilfiger added, ''to view himself as being very sexy and masculine but with a certain femininity.''

With his shoe-blacked hair and eyebrows (his natural color was sandy brown), his rolled sleeves and smudgy eyes, he was an instinctive manipulator of symbols, a forerunner of the modern celebrity and the progenitor of an image whose life span extends to generations barely aware of his music, as even a casual stroll through the sideburns and pompadours of the Lower East Side or Williamsburg makes plain.

''From the early pictures you can see him transforming himself, and picking out the sharpest duds he can find,'' Mr. Strausbaugh said. ''He completely understood on some level, maybe just intuitively, the need to craft and manipulate one's image and that clothes have a lot to do with that.''

It helped, of course that Elvis always, from the very beginning, loved clothes. ''My favorite hobby is collecting these real cool outfits,'' he once told a reporter. ''I'd almost rather wear them than eat.''","THE weeping fans and screaming mobs seem a universe away from the hush of a knoll at Graceland.

Today’s answer to the question: “How can more women leaders instill confidence in the workplace?” is written by Racquel Oden, managing director and market executive for the New York 5th Avenue office at Merrill Lynch.

No matter what field you’re in, building a successful career requires hard work and passion. And most importantly, confidence. There have been countless studies on what holds women back from reaching their potential in the workplace, and recent research has found that although many women aspire to be a senior leader or serve on a board, they also report hesitancy in taking steps to reach these types of roles.

As I’ve continued to grow and evolve in my own career, I’ve seen a number of factors contribute to growth in confidence – both for myself and others. One key takeaway is to keep challenging yourself and taking opportunities that allow you to diversify your capabilities, strengthen your leadership skills and build a broader network. “What do you want to be when you grow up” is a question we should ask ourselves well into our careers. Below are four other questions to instill greater value and comfort in your own capabilities, and ultimately increase your confidence:

Am I embracing risk? My mentor once told me to “be comfortably uncomfortable.” She encouraged me to push myself just beyond my comfort zone in order to learn new roles, meet new challenges, and continue to grow in my career. Ambition sparks growth, and growth re-energizes ambition. If we embrace risk instead of hiding from it, we’re more likely to stay engaged, learn more and continue to achieve. Whenever I feel hesitant or uncertain, I remind myself that risk can come with great reward. Some of the biggest risks I’ve taken have had the best impact on my career and leadership growth.

Am I playing to my strengths? People tend to be good at what they care most about, and if you’re good at something, don’t hide behind it! Whether you’re the best at connecting with important clients, or you’re the only one in the office who knows how to use the scanner, people will remember your skill and your confidence. Even if your expertise isn’t the most glamorous.

Am I taking advantage of change? Change in the workplace can be hard to adapt to, and all too often many of us fear it. Yet when employees leave, new hires come on, or new departments and policies come to fruition, these are the best opportunities to showcase your skills and confidence. On the other end of the spectrum, if you’re not encountering enough change, prioritize talking with your manager to make sure you’re on a growing trajectory.

Am I owning (and learning) from my mistakes? Making a mistake at work can be one of the most confidence-depleting aspects of your career, but owning mistakes will help you get it right the next time. Not only is taking responsibility for mistakes a crucial skill to have for leadership roles, but it’s also a great way to build your poise. Once you can get comfortable with your ability to take the blame and recover, you’ll be less hesitant when it comes to taking the lead on projects or group discussions. If you can acknowledge your mistakes — quickly, not dwelling on them — and then propose solutions, people will value you, and you’ll believe in you.",It will also boost your confidence.,97.8571428571,0.8571428571,1.7142857142999999,high,medium,mixed,architecture

In many countries, the typical method of opening an account isnât feasible, due not only to a lack of enough money to place in an account to make service fees acceptable, but also long travel distances and paperwork that is hard for many people to understand, especially those with low levels of literacy.

2.5 billion peopleâhalf the worldâs adult populationâare âunbanked.â

The worldâs poor need the stability and security that banks have traditionally offeredâand now providers in some countries are finding other ways to offer those services using technology and network agents, without building more bank branches.

For example, in Bangladesh, the percentage of unbanked is even lower than the world average: only 13 percent of the countryâs 160 million people have a bank account.

Launched in 2011, the company bKashâbacked by BRAC Bank and Money in Motion (later joined by International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)âmoved to attack the problem. Employing a network of community-based agents, bKash began putting in place a system of branchless banking services using electronic money that can be stored and transferred via mobile phones.

The move effectively provided access to financial services without adding cost to banks (bank branches are expensive to build and staff) and changed the way an increasing number of Bangladesh citizens use and save money.

Today, bKash is the worldâs second largest mobile financial services company, with 16 million accounts and 110,000 agents spread throughout every corner of the country. Recipients can walk to bKash retail agents in small grocery stores, pharmaciesâeven butcher shopsâthat give physical cash in exchange for e-money for a small service fee.

The agents are the frontline in providing servicesâwithout buildingsâby acting as a bridge for customers between cash and e-money. Once an agent adds money to usersâ mobile money accounts, people can transfer and save money without ever entering a bank.

âbKash has become the collective mattress for the whole country,â says bKash CEO Kamal Quadir. âThe effort of four very distinct forces, all connected by the common goal of creating inclusivity, is what has made bKash so powerful.â The use of bKash has become so popular, itâs now part of the vernacular. âbKash korunâ (âbKash it to meâ) is commonly used to mean sending money to each other.

In many countries, the typical method of opening an account isnât feasible.

By enlisting agents from its pool of microentrepreneurs, BRAC was able to build trust and excitement about bKash. From there, agentsâmost of whom were already in the business of selling airtime credit for mobile phonesâset about encouraging customers to register for bKash by âexplaining the benefits in a way that made sense,â says Shahid Ullah, a team leader in the research and development unit of BRACâs microfinance program, who ran the initiative to recruit the first bKash agents in 2011.

To do this, many agents would send their customers a small sum of money through bKashâto prove that it workedâand then have the customer send it back the same way. âThe early stages of spreading bKashâfrom BRAC, to agent, to customerâwere largely about building trust,â Ullah says. Even now, years later, âthe role of the agent is still central, as clients can go to agents for assistance. Gradually they gain confidence, and more and more want to benefit from the same servicesâin turn benefiting the agent with whom new customers have to sign up.â

Mohammad Zillur Rahman, a bKash agent based in the urban area of Dhaka, says that these days, people donât need persuading when it comes to using mobile money because it fills a real need in the community. âMany of the bKash users are poor people who have come to cities for jobs,â he says. âThey feel good, as they can quickly send the money to their parents and relatives, and the recipients can also cash out the money within a short time.â

While the majority of bKash customers use the service to transfer money and make payments, a âmeaningful percentageâ of them have some kind of savings, Quadir says, and this number has been steadily increasing each quarter. Presently, close to one million people receive interest on their money, some for the first time in their lives. (bKash offers interest that increases according to the amount of money in the accountâup to 4 percent annually.)

Whether citizens are using bKash to pay or save, Quadir notes that the introduction of e-money has had a large-scale impact on the country. âThe beauty of putting money in an electronic platform versus in their pockets, is that the money collectively becomes part of a large pool of cash, and the poor are contributing to macroeconomic activities like building factories, roads and other macroeconomic activities,â he says.","Half the worldâs adult population are âunbanked,â meaning they have no access to bank accounts and no safe, affordable place to save their money.",35.6071428571,0.9285714286000001,8.2857142857,high,medium,extractive,architecture

US rescue workers have pulled a woman, injured but alive, from the rubble of building that had collapsed nearly three hours earlier in a South Dakota city.

Crews continued searching for a second person believed to be trapped under the debris of the brick building in downtown Sioux Falls.

The woman, 22, was rushed to the hospital.

""She's alive and well. Does have some injuries to her legs. We don't know the extent of that at this time,"" said Sioux Falls emergency manager Regan Smith.

The other person trapped is a construction worker, said Sioux Falls Fire Rescue Chief Jim Sideras.

Rescue workers also pulled a dog, alive, from the rubble.

Mr Sideras said the woman who was rescued had been able to communicate by phone with her mother during the ordeal.

He said she couldn't see daylight so rescue crews knew she was buried deeply in debris.

http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/17/architecture-misogyny-zaha-hadid,http://web.archive.org/web/20140829144249id_/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/17/architecture-misogyny-zaha-hadid,Zaha Hadid: Britain must do more to help encourage its women architects,1970-08-22 02:40:29.144249,"In a damning indictment of the prevailing culture of her own profession, Dame Zaha Hadid, the world's leading female architect, says she has faced ""more misogynist behaviour"" in London than anywhere else in Europe and that things are not improving at all for women in architecture.

Speaking to the Observer in the wake of the disturbing findings of a survey into the working lives of women architects, Hadid said: ""I have noticed it is easier for me in European countries than it is here. There is a different dynamic. In the UK it is more difficult. They are very conservative. There is a scepticism and more misogynist behaviour here. Although, while there were people against me, there were also people living here who were incredibly supportive.""

The British Iraqi, who is a former winner of Britain's Stirling prize and the international Pritzker prize, said it was frequently assumed that a woman architect could not take on a big commercial project and that she was better suited to residential properties, public buildings or leisure centres. ""I am sure that as a woman I can do a very good skyscraper,"" she said. ""I don't think it is only for men.""

The acclaimed architect, best known in Britain for the Aquatics Centre in the Olympic Park, recognised a bias that pushes women towards designing interiors. ""It is thought they understand interior shapes, and I am sure they do understand them better than men actually, but the idea is that they will prefer to deal with a single client, rather than with corporations and developers.""

Her remarks this weekend were prompted by research carried out by the Architects' Journal that revealed a ""sinister and rotten kernel of inequality"" in British architecture and the shocking fact that two thirds of women who responded reported ""insidious"" male bullying at work. Sixty per cent also said that clients in the building industry failed to recognise their authority.

While the cover stars of the new AJ are Walters & Cohen, joint winners of last year's AJ woman architect of the year award, Hadid gives no credence to the idea that things are getting better: ""No, I don't think so. What AJ is doing is very good and the editor, Christine Murray, has been very active, but I doubt anything has changed much over the last 30 years.""

In 2003 The Royal Institute of British Architects raised the issue with its report Why Do Women Leave Architecture? but Hadid believes it has not done nearly enough, despite having had two consecutive female presidents since September 2009, Ruth Reed and Angela Brady. ""In my view the changes within Riba are nonexistent,"" she said. Last year Hadid won the Jane Drew award in recognition of her influence on the industry. Her acceptance speech dealt with the high-profile row surrounding the competition to build Cardiff Bay Opera House. She still sees the incident as typical: ""I had a very bad experience in Cardiff and then with the foundation building I was designing in London. There was just a reluctance to go out of the box with thinking.""

While numbers of male and female architecture students are equally balanced, only just above 20% of qualified architects are women.

""It is a very tough industry and it is male-dominated, not just in architectural practices, but the developers and the builders too,"" said Hadid. ""I can't blame the men, though. The problem is continuity. Society has not been set up in a way that allows women to go back to work after taking time off. Many women now have to work as well as do everything at home and no one can do everything. Society needs to find a way of relieving women. It may be a little easier now, with new technology, for a woman to take off six months or a year and then come back.""

Drop-out rates following motherhood may also be related to the lower rates of pay for women architects that make it hard for them to afford childcare. The AJ survey showed that almost half of women were paid less than their male equivalents for the same job.

""Like men, women have to be diligent and work hard. I have quite a few senior architects in the office and they are extremely reliable and very talented, but, when I taught, all my best students were women. Then they drift off,"" said Hadid, who has designed the Middle East Centre, or ""Softbridge"", now being constructed in Oxford.

She believes women need to be encouraged and to have their confidence built up. ""I was very lucky because my family always believed that I could do it.""

Although AJ warns that British urban design may be damaged by the lack of women architects, Hadid welcomes the ""exciting"" changing skyline of London. She has two provisos though: women should be allowed to handle major projects and there should be an overall strategy shaping new developments.

""People used to think women did not have enough logic. Well, that is absolute nonsense. I don't know the ego of a man, or how their mentality works, but there is no difference at all in capability, not formally in terms of the buildings at least. There might be differences in women's leadership qualities or in their ego issues, but we can design in the same way if we have the chance.""

She argues that London should consider copying Paris by designating specific areas for skyscrapers. ""London has to decide where it is going,"" she says.

Such issues should be debated, Hadid argues, ""not to nit-pick, but because it affects the amount of light and shadow in the city.""",The world's leading female architect says women in the UK are pushed away from leading big projects,61.7777777778,0.8333333333,2.7222222222,high,medium,mixed,architecture

After a year of war and political upheaval that has seen its currency plummet and sent its economy into a tailspin, Ukraine agreed a $17.5 billion, four-year bailout facility with the International Monetary Fund this month. The deal obliges Kiev to restructure at least $15.3 billion of outstanding debt.

Creditors have been told the restructuring will involve a reduction in coupon and face value, as well as maturity extensions, though many have suggested Kiev could just extend maturities for now while it re-assesses its finances and decide later what kind of writedowns it must inflict, if any.

Yaresko said that would not make sense.

""Just maturity extension does not get us within the three goals that we agreed to with the IMF, it doesn't get us to the level of debt sustainability that I think we need,"" the finance minister told Reuters in an interview in London.

""We are trying to do this once and to do this in a way that gives us the breathing space, the cushion that we need going forward,"" she said, adding this was the lesson learned from previous restructurings, including Greece.

A source familiar with Ukraine's thinking and close to the talks had said earlier there would be no ""extend and pretend,"" referring to the option of just prolonging repayment times. This option would simply bring Ukraine back to the creditors' table at a later stage, the source said.

Yaresko has been on a whirlwind trip to meet 15 of the top holders of Ukraine's bonds. They include American investment firm Franklin Templeton, which holds some $6.5 billion worth of bonds, or over a third of all outstanding sovereign issues.

She earlier told investors she expected to start talks with an ad hoc creditor committee by Monday or Tuesday next week.

Yaresko also said there would be no benefit to any creditors to ""hold out"" - refuse to participate in the restructuring with a view to extracting more money.

Greece's debt restructuring most recently, saw some funds holding out and ultimately going on to recover far more of their investment than those agreeing for a settlement. That raised the specter that this would be repeated in future debt workouts.

""I don't see that as a real option here - our goal is to bring as many people in as possible, and I don't think being a hold out is necessarily a better option in our case,"" she said.

""We don't have the type of bailout package that Greece has, we don't have the type of cushion that Greece has.""

Yaresko quashed speculation of a Brady-style restructuring that would see creditors take a writedown, but in return get a bond that would effectively be guaranteed by the United States.

""It does not seem to be possible at this time,"" she said. Asked if she meant Ukraine had not raised this option or whether Washington did not offer it, she said:

""The U.S. is not offering it.""

Another big bondholder is Russia, which holds $3 billion due in December this year.

Moscow has repeatedly said it is not ready to restructure Ukraine's debt and expects Kiev to repay what it owes.

Russia has also suggested that its bonds should be classed as sovereign or official sector debt and should not be subject to restructuring under the IMF deal. That would indicate it considers its bonds as subject to discussion by the Paris Club of creditors, rather the London Club, which encompasses debt owed to the private sector.

Asked her opinion, Yaresko said:

""To me it is clear (that they are London club). They are a Eurobond, but they are saying they are not London club. I am not going to do the work for them.""

She said that once the Russian bondholders decided how to proceed, Ukraine would ""adjust and adapt and take it into account.""

http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/14/haiti-rebuilding-disaster-zone-architecture/amp,http://web.archive.org/web/20151002141617id_/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/14/haiti-rebuilding-disaster-zone-architecture/amp,Haiti and the demands of disaster-zone architecture,1970-08-22 05:30:02.141617,"Most people witnessing the devastation in Haiti have felt ­powerless to help, but not architects. Since the earthquake on 12 January, some 350 British architects have volunteered their services to ­Article 25, the UK's leading architectural aid charity. There has been a ­similar ­response in the US: design ­charity ­Architecture For Humanity (AFH) had 600 enquiries a day in the week after the disaster. Obviously, there is a­ ­colossal job of reconstruction to be done. Roughly one third of the capital, Port-au-Prince, has been ­destroyed, and some 2 million people have been made homeless.

For now, there are more immediate concerns: treating the wounded, getting in supplies, restoring sanitation, and grieving for the dead. ""Now would be exactly the wrong time to pitch up in Haiti,"" Robin Cross, ­Article 25's director of projects, tells me. ""You would simply be another burden on a very strained ­infrastructure."" Kate Stohr, co-founder of AFH, agrees. ""You don't go in and talk about building new schools when people are grieving. The first reconstruction doesn't typically start for six to nine months, and there will be a period of three to five years where we'll be ­actively working and need volunteers. ""

In the broader sense, though, there is plenty that architects can and are ­doing. Natural and man-made disasters have created similar circumstances around the world, where homes, schools, hospitals, and other structures are needed quickly and cheaply. In addition, according to the UN, one in seven people now live in slum ­conditions. One of its millennium ­development goals is to improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers by 2015. These are real, urgent problems for architects to solve.

As an example of what could be done in Haiti, Cross points to Article 25's work in northern Pakistan. After the 2005 earthquake destroyed the homes of some 3.5 million people, the charity, in partnership with Muslim Aid, has been building seismic-resistant homes there for those not able to do so themselves. These houses are a variation on a local design, except with a new lightweight structural frame made up of small lengths of timber. They don't look very different from the outside – low, single-storey dwellings rendered in mud and stone – but in the event of another earthquake, they will flex rather than collapse entirely. The houses are also secured to concrete plinths with steel straps, so they are less likely to be shaken off the hillsides, as happened in 2005. It's simple, low-tech stuff, and necessarily so, says Cross. ""There is a place for ­innovation, but it's often best to adopt the materials and skills found locally. We've built about 100 houses there so far, but we've also used each one of them as an exercise in training people. It's ­important that when we leave we haven't just left buildings behind – we've also left a community with an increased capacity to rebuild itself.""

Much of this architecture has a no-nonsense honesty and stripped down-functionalism that would please the less-is-more forefathers of the modern movement. It also makes much of what we do in the west look frivolous and ­extravagant by comparison. AFH published a book of such projects four years ago, Design Like You Give A Damn; there is now so much of this sort of humanitarian design going on, they are ­working on a sequel. (The same year, AFH also formed openarchitecturenetwork.org, a website where architects can publish their designs for peer review and free use by anyone who sees fit. On its homepage, they have adapted Le Corbusier's famous maxim ­""architecture or revolution"": ""We don't need to choose between ­architecture or revolution. What we need is an ­architectural revolution.""

If this is a revolution, it is one that could only have happened in the information age. AFH was founded in 1999 by Stohr and Cameron Sinclair, two San Francisco-based architects. Witnessing returning refugees in Kosovo, they ­decided to hold an open online design competition for temporary housing and received hundreds of entries from around the world. From there, they spread into work in sub-Saharan Africa, and disaster zones including the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami. The organisation now has 80 chapters in 25 countries, and a network of 40,000 professionals. ""It's very life-affirming for architects,"" says Stohr. ""On these projects, when you finish, you get a hug from the client.""

Another consequence of the ­information age is the emergence of the celebrity-driven development project. In Haiti alone, AFH is now working with Ben Stiller's charity Stiller Strong (motto: ""Stealing great ideas from other people's charities to build a school in Haiti""). Stiller founded his ­organisation before the earthquake, and is now roping in friends such as Robert de Niro and Owen Wilson to raise funds. AFH are also working with singer Shakira, whose Barefoot Foundation plans to build schools in Haiti. Haitian-born rapper Wyclef Jean, meanwhile, has his Yéle Foundation, which has been involved in a number of projects, including the construction of a new music studio in Cité Soleil.

The pioneer of the celebrity development field would probably be Brad Pitt and his Make It Right Foundation. The actor, an architecture enthusiast, visited New Orleans two years after Hurricane Katrina and – frustrated by the slow pace of reconstruction – ­recruited 21 architects to design new houses for the devastated Lower 9th ward, including Frank Gehry, David Adjaye, Thom Mayne and Shigeru Ban. This has resulted in an assortment of funky housing types that are affordable, storm-resistant (they are raised on stilts) and green, with features such as solar panels and rainwater harvesting. Pitt's charity has been criticised, though, for transplanting alien architecture into a context where it wasn't called for. One non-Make It Right resident, of a standard single-storey house, ­complained of feeling ""like a Mini Cooper boxed in by SUVs"". 54 houses have been completed so far, ­although 150 are under construction.

Similar concerns have been raised about the reconstruction of Haiti. ""It would be easy to regard this catastrophe as some kind of blank slate on which an architect can come along and define a new masterplan, but you need to treat the subject with much more ­caution,"" says Cross. ""Although the physical infrastructure has been badly destroyed, there are remaining social and economic infrastructures. You need to pick up those threads and build a new Haiti around them.""

Architect John McAslan agrees. He returned from Haiti recently, ­having been involved in development work there before the earthquake, particularly on architectural conservation projects. One thing that rarely gets mentioned is Haiti's outstanding ­historic architecture, including its US Victorian-influenced ""gingerbread"" houses – tall, ornate constructions decked with towers, turrets, balconies. ""One of my great fears is that some of the damaged historical buildings that survived will be demolished,"" says McAslan. ""You can't be too concerned about the heritage when there are lives to be saved, but I think one needs to hold onto the past.""

Like many practices, McAslan's puts a portion of its resources towards pro bono work around the world. Alongside projects like London's new King's Cross station, the firm has won acclaim for low-tech work such as prototype schools in Malawi, in cooperation with Bill Clinton's development charity. Made of local brick and timber, these smart, simple buildings are designed to optimise natural cooling, harvest rainwater and do without electric lighting – perfect for Malawi's remote villages. McAslan could well be doing similar work in Haiti soon; Clinton's initiative has again enlisted him to help with the ­rebuilding effort.

""What's needed most urgently in Haiti is coordination,"" says McAslan. ""If there isn't any, there's a real danger a lot of effort and good intentions will be wasted."" The rainy season is fast approaching, and with it the threat of sanitation-related diseases, not to mention hurricanes. In 2008 alone, Haiti was hit by four hurricanes, and the temporary shelters in which many Haitians now live will not stand up to another one. ""We need coordination, we need short-term preparedness for the rainy season, and we need a long-term commitment to reconstruction.""

With such pressing survival issues, is it appropriate to be thinking about architectural revolutions or questions of aesthetics? Yes, says Stohr. ""Aesthetics are terribly important. Imagine you're a child and you've lost everything and lived in tents for five years. That's half your life. It is actually really important after a disaster to build back beautifully. It brings back a sense of normalcy. When all those beloved landmarks are gone, if you replace them with things that don't have cultural meaning and aren't, frankly, beautiful, you're not ­rebuilding that community.""

After returning home, Sophie, a precocious child of about 8, mailed Ms. Goodell a drawing she had done of her.

The work amazed Ms. Goodell, who dated Mr. Crumb, the creator of Mr. Natural and Fritz the Cat, for about five years in the 1970's. ''It was uncanny,'' Ms. Goodell said. ''It was a cartoon drawing but it had a realism to it. She's very talented. It totally captured my essence, probably in a way that Robert's drawings never did.''

That talent is shared by other members of the Crumb family, who will be featured in at least five exhibits in Manhattan over the next few months. Robert Crumb's drawings are on display in a group show at Feigen Contemporary through July 27, and his work will be shown in a solo exhibit at the Paul Morris Gallery in November. His older brother Charles's notebooks are part of a group show at the 303 Gallery through July 19.

Sophie, who did the drawings in a sketchbook that Thora Birch's character carried in the 2001 film ''Ghost World,'' makes her gallery debut with a drawing in ''Something, Anything,'' a group show at Matthew Marks Gallery. Her mother, Aline Kominsky-Crumb, will be in a group show opening at the Jewish Museum in February.

Mr. Morris said the spate of Crumb exhibits was coincidental but not surprising. The Crumbs are excellent draftsmen, he said, and have distinctive styles. ''Everybody's going after them for their art, not their familial ties,'' he said. ''They're all really interesting artists for very different reasons.''

Sophie, 20, an English teacher in Paris, draws mostly people and currently favors caricatures of hip young Parisians with rodent faces. She recently wrote and illustrated a children's book, ''The Secret of Joe the Weasel,'' which she hopes to publish.

Aline painted and drew comics before she met Robert 30 years ago and now makes jewel-encrusted, ornate shrines inspired by her travels to India and Mexico. Her piece in the Jewish Museum show will be a shrine to Betty Boop.

Jesse Crumb, 34, Robert's son with Dana Morgan, his first wife, lives in Northern California and does illustrative drawings and paintings. Robert said the Crumb name has been problematic for Jesse.

''Jesse said all his life people expected him to be a good artist because he's my son,'' Robert Crumb said in a telephone interview from his home in southern France, where he and Ms. Kominsky-Crumb have lived since 1990. ''It's idiotic, but that's just human nature, I guess.''

Maxon Crumb, Robert's younger brother, makes abstract, Cubist-influenced oil paintings. The most eccentric family member, he has lived in a skid row hotel in San Francisco for 18 years and frequently sits on the streets, a beggar's bowl in front of him.

Nayland Blake, an artist who organized the show at Matthew Marks, said the cartoon genre favored by Sophie and Robert, whose works are often autobiographical, has a directness and emotional honesty that's difficult to find in contemporary art. ''I think people are hungry for those things,'' Mr. Blake said. ''The format that they work in answers a lot of needs that are not so easily met by things like painting.''

Considered by turns a pioneer and a pornographer, Robert Crumb has used cartooning to explore once-taboo topics like incest, racism and misogyny. But he draws mostly for print (he is publishing a new book of comics this month) and has avoided the galleries. In fact, he was largely overlooked until ''Crumb,'' a 1994 documentary film about the family by his friend Terry Zwigoff, who also directed ''Ghost World.''

Growing up with an overbearing father, a Marine who broke the 5-year-old Robert's collarbone, and a mother hooked on amphetamines, the three Crumb boys -- Charles, Robert and Maxon -- retreated into the world of comic books. On the direction of the reclusive Charles they drew comics, frequently recreating characters from the 1950 Disney film ''Treasure Island,'' which obsessed Charles.

Over time, Charles's finely rendered comic-book characters became squeezed out by ever-expanding balloons of words until only text remained. His notebooks show line after line of illegible text, disturbing in their compulsive uniformity. Charles, who committed suicide in 1993, lived his whole life, except for six weeks in 1960, in his parents' home.

Sophie said that though her parents had encouraged her creativity by drawing with her and showing her old black-and-white cartoons from the 1930's, she was enormously influenced by her uncle Charles's drawings. ''I thought they were so good,'' she said. ''I thought they were better than my dad's, actually.''

The Crumb family raises the old nature-nurture debate: is artistic ability innate or learned? Mr. Blake said the Crumbs are an example of what can happen when the natural tendency to draw is not repressed.

''As a child, everybody draws, and then you're taught that there are good drawings and bad drawings, and people start getting discouraged,'' he said. ''In the absence of that, you'd have a lot more of this in families.''

(Matthew Marks Gallery, New York)","DURING a visit to New York more than a decade ago, Sophie Crumb went with her father, the cartoonist Robert Crumb, to visit one of his former girlfriends, the artist Kathy Goodell. After returning home, Sophie, a precocious child of about 8, mailed Ms. Goodell a drawing she had done of her.    The work amazed Ms. Goodell, who dated Mr. Crumb, the creator of Mr. Natural and Fritz the Cat, for about five years in the 1970's. ''It was uncanny,'' Ms. Goodell said. ''It was a cartoon drawing but it had a realism to it. She's very talented. It totally captured my essence, probably in a way that Robert's drawings never did.''",8.1631205674,0.9929078014,70.6524822695,low,high,extractive,architecture

Well, yes; Kenneth Ross, the incumbent of All Saints, Margaret Street, at the time might well have turned puce at the thought. ""Yet,"" continued Ian Nairn, writing in the mid-1960s of William Butterfield's intense Gothic Revival church built a century earlier, ""this building can only be understood in terms of compelling passion. Here is the force of Wuthering Heights translated into dusky red and black bricks, put down in a mundane Marylebone street to rivet you, pluck you into the courtyard with its hard welcoming wings and quivering steeple.""

This provocative entry from Nairn's London, published by Penguin in 1966, jumps from the page, as did much of Nairn's sharp-shadowed and beautifully written journalism and books. He made his debut in 1955 with ""Outrage"", an iconoclastic and hugely influential issue of the Architectural Review, and spent his ember days at Harry Evans's Sunday Times in the late 1970s. Sadly, in his last five years, Nairn, one of the greatest of all topographical writers, wrote little or nothing. He gave up a welcoming newspaper office in Bloomsbury for the public bar of St George's Tavern, Pimlico, where he sank a fatal tide of Guinness. He died of cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 52.

This was in 1983, and I was lucky enough to meet him that year when I was a young assistant editor with the AR. I say ""lucky"", but the writer I met was a pale shadow of the ""outraged"" Nairn of the mid-1950s. I was too late.

Jonathan Meades, the writer and television presenter, had been to see Nairn some months earlier, in the St George's Tavern, in the vain hope of getting this influential, yet largely forgotten, literary figure to write for Tina Brown's Tatler.

""It was like watching someone dissolve in front of your eyes,"" says Meades. ""I've seldom seen a less healthy looking person. His lunch was 14 pints of beer. He looked dropsical. It was as if his whole career had been a graph of disillusionment, and all that was left was an abyss.""

Nairn's decline and fall might well seem strange if all we knew of him was a list of his undoubted achievements. A brilliant ""angry young man"" whose searing ""outrage"" quickly turned into a book that won the hearts of newspapers from the Daily Mirror to the Manchester Guardian, was published a year before John Osborne's Look Back in Anger. Nairn went on to write for the Daily Telegraph, the Observer and the Sunday Times, and presented a long run of heart-on-sleeve films for the BBC in the 60s and 70s. A tireless traveller through Britain and across Europe, Australia and the United States, he co-authored the Surrey (1962) and Sussex (1965) volumes of Nikolaus Pevsner's indispensable Buildings of England series, and was a guiding spirit among the younger generation that continued the crusade for conservation in the footsteps of another former AR assistant editor, John Betjeman.

Nairn had been a champion of modern architecture when he joined the AR, with its picturesque offices in Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster, in 1954. Within a decade, though, he was struggling to find new buildings worthy of the new Britain he had so wanted to believe in when he took up journalism after a three-year spell in the RAF, flying Gloster Meteor jet fighters after national service.

He made his instant mark with ""Outrage"", a fearless and revelatory attack on what was fast becoming the unbridled banality of Britain's landscape and ""townscape"", as the AR labelled the art of the way we should be making our towns and cities. For Nairn and the AR, a journey, by Morris Minor, from Southampton to Carlisle said it all. He forged a word for what he saw: Subtopia – ""its symptom will be that the end of Southampton will look like the beginning of Carlisle; the parts in between will look like the end of Carlisle or the beginning of Southampton."" And the outrage? ""The Outrage is that the whole land surface is becoming covered by the creeping mildew that already circumscribes all of our towns ... Subtopia is the annihilation of the site, the steamrollering of all individuality of place to one uniform and mediocre pattern.""

This could have been William Cobbett riding his hobby-horse across southern England: ""All Middlesex is ugly,"" he thundered in 1830 in one of the pugnacious chapter openings of Rural Rides. Much the same theme had been taken up by John Ruskin, John Betjeman, the architect Clough Williams-Ellis, who gave us Portmeirion in north Wales, and Thomas Sharp, a 20th-century town planner who believed that postwar modern architecture and development could be reconciled with the humane ideal – felt by Nairn in the bones of his burly frame – of compact towns co-existing with a truly green countryside of which we are stewards, not consumers or despoilers.

""You have to remember,"" says Meades, ""that when Nairn wrote ""Outrage"", building licences [along with ration books], had only just been repealed. So, in some ways Nairn was hoping for, and writing about, something that didn't exist, anticipating a utopian revelation from a new generation of architects who weren't even building. And, when they did, he found himself scratching about for what was good, and couldn't find it.""

""Outrage"", however, brought the 25-year-old Nairn to the attention of Fleet Street. As new buildings and planning disappointed him, so he turned to the world of books, journalism and television, and away from architects themselves. He had no architectural background or training, nor any intention of becoming a historian of the high-minded school of Kenneth Clark, John Summerson or John Pope-Hennessy. Journalism, travel and pubs were much more his thing.

Born in Bedford in August 1930, he was the son of an engineering draughtsman working on the government-sponsored R101 dirigible, a titanic airship designed by VC Richmond at the Royal Airship Works at nearby Cardington. The R101 crashed in France on its maiden voyage in October 1930. The family moved to Frimley, a small Surrey town of the kind parodied by Betjeman. Nairn lived here until he went to Birmingham University to study maths before taking to the skies with the RAF.

Perhaps he had seen Britain's towns sprawling, its countryside under threat from the vantage point of his Meteor jet. On the ground, he set architectural journalism ablaze. Within weeks of the publication of ""Outrage"", the Duke of Edinburgh was speaking of ""Subtopia"", while, as Christopher Hurst recalled in his 1997 publishing memoirs, The View from King Street, ""Duncan Sandys, the [Tory] Minister of Housing took up the theme, doubtless with some opportunism because the worst 'outrages' emanated from Labour-controlled councils.""

Nairn never fitted comfortably into the world of professional men and women, nor that of bureaucrats and politicians. ""Professional books on town planning are often of no assistance,"" he said, ""and may be harmful."" Instead, he recommended a one-inch Ordnance Survey map and ""a pair of uncommitted eyes"". Even when the Civic Trust was set up, in 1957, to help tackle ""Subtopia"", Nairn refused to join. He resembled the character Patrick McGoohan was to play, 10 years later, in the TV drama The Prisoner: ""I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed or numbered. My life is my own."" As was his writing.

""Space here,"" he wrote of Nicholas Hawskmoor's Portland stone bulldog of a protestant prayerbox, St Mary Woolnoth, ""is made so tangible that you can experience for the price of a bus ticket to the City the super-reality of the mystics, or mescalin ..."" Of the finely poised juxtaposition of Denys Lasdun's 26 St James's Place, built in 1959, and John Vardy and ""Athenian"" Stuart's Spencer House (1754), Nairn observed that these ""totally dissimilar"" buildings were as ""inseparable as Guinness and oysters"".

Nairn's great contribution to architectural and topographical writing and broadcasting is that he took his audiences to the most unexpected places and buildings. His exhaustive, revelatory itinerary of Britain was as much concerned with the City of London as it was with Uxbridge or Dagenham, Northampton or Stockport.

On film, you catch something of his abiding melancholy, along with his habitual scruffiness and a haunting sense that here was a man as much in search of himself as he was of the inspired new architecture that eluded him. And in search, too, of a romantic, everyday Britain that, from Millwall to Manchester, was vanishing under a tide of crude public and private development. Those falling cadences, the way his sentences drop quietly into ideas left hanging, things unsaid, are as haunting as they are disturbing. There was an ineffable sadness at work. Nairn truly detested the way we were selling (as we continue to) our landscape, our townscapes, for a mess of nothing worth looking at, much less living in or handing down to our children. He and Judy remained childless; he didn't much see the point of bringing children into a subtopian world.

""He was a great Fleet Street colleague,"" says Brian Jackson, the travel writer and ecologist who shared an office with him at the Sunday Times from 1970. ""He was large, genial and unkempt, squeezed into a cheap suit that he must have slept in. A white shirt always, top button undone with a loose, off-centre tie. He tootled around the country in his Morris, came back to The Blue Lion in Gray's Inn Road, sank several pints and hand-wrote his stories. No one changed a word. He was indulged because he was good, one of Harry Evans's inspired mavericks, and encouraged, as we all were, to write to our enthusiasms. Hard to imagine today.""

Ian Jack, another of Nairn's Sunday Times colleagues, recalls: ""Ian was funny. He'd answer the phone saying things like 'Weasel, Stoat and Polecat', as if he were some pompous provincial solicitor. Sometimes he'd answer the phone with a bark – woof, woof! Perhaps it was the drink. He had the seasoned drinker's habit of gripping his pint from the bottom of the glass. Not a delicate drinker. He was shy, ruminative and kind, and always looked sad. On TV you heard that catch in the voice, saw those watery eyes ...""

According to Jackson, Nairn said hewanted to be buried under the flightpath into Heathrow. ""Then, sometime in the late 70s, he pressed the self-destruct button."" Nairn is indeed buried under the flightpath at Heathrow, in a hard-to-find grave in Hanwell cemetery, alongside the roaring Uxbridge Road. His spirit, however, is very much abroad, and we need it today, as one ""outrage"" follows another.

Writers and journalists, including JG Ballard, Will Self, Jonathan Meades, Patrick Wright, Iain Sinclair, Gavin Stamp (Private Eye's perennially outraged ""Piloti""), as well as a younger generation of commentators such as Owen Hatherley and the mysterious blogger, Ghost of Nairn, have all been influenced one way or another by Nairn, who so wanted everywhere to be different when everywhere was threatening to be the same.

Photo: David Sillitoe

God created Quinlan Terry in 1937. Or was it the BBC in 1988? That was the year they made a series of 50-minute TV documentaries, led by the Prince of Wales, about architecture, planning and heritage under the banner Visions of Britain. Terry's contribution was subtitled Classicism: The Rejected Alternative. It opened with the immaculately tailored, 50-year-old architect looking like an undertaker skulking in what appeared to be a candle-lit crypt. In funereal tones, Terry explained how God Himself had handed down the orders of classical architecture - Doric, Ionic, Corinthian - to mankind. Classical architecture was not simply more beautiful than soulless modern tosh, it was divinely inspired.

This, though, was a hoary old argument trotted out in previous centuries in praise of rival styles. In the 1840s, the pugnacious young Augustus Pugin argued that Gothic was the one true style for English architecture because it was Christian and this was a Christian country. Pugin's Catholic zealotry caught the imagination of those who commissioned and designed the muscular new Christian buildings of Victorian Britain, from colleges to cathedrals and even the rows of houses in between. Gothic was God-given.

An architect who believed he had God on his side in the money-mad 1980s, however, was as rare as a decent new public building. For a good 15 minutes, the media loved Terry, or ""God's architect"", as he was labelled. Indeed, with the opening of his Richmond Riverside scheme along the Thames the year before, and his commissions for country houses for the new City rich and his white stucco villas in Regent's Park for the Crown Estate, Terry's assortment of divinely inspired classical designs could hardly be described as a rejected alternative.

And, then, nothing. Neither a cornice nor a pediment. Not so much as a carved wooden pineapple to delight a gatepost. In the years since the media lost interest in the Prince Charles carbuncle debate, you rarely heard the name Quinlan Terry uttered in public. Had the architect gone to Heaven? Was he busy redesigning the Pearly Gates? No. Terry remained happily ensconced in Constable country (his studio in Dedham) doing God's work here, there and, almost without anyone noticing, slap, bang in the middle of London.

Baker Street, to be precise. Here in all its divine glory, is Terry's latest work: a big, ultra-modern office block; a concatenation of suspended ceilings, fluorescent lighting, brushed steel and glass-sided stairwells supported by breeze blocks, concrete screeds and the spirit of God.

Not that you would guess at first glance. For this is architecture as Quality Street scenography, a grouping of genuine Georgian town houses, some in rich, dark brick, others in penny-plain but handsomely lain yellow London stock brick, and, in between, the centrepiece, a show-off Palladian facade realised finely cut Portland stone.

It is architectural wrapping paper, a neo-Georgian facade folded crisply around a modern office block. You can argue that there is nothing wrong with dressing up an office block in Palladian ruffs and frills; it certainly softens the blow of what would otherwise be just another of the soulless buildings that have turned Baker Street from a handsome Georgian street into an alley of crapulous offices that might belong to any third-rate European town. But the effect, indeed the whole conceit, is spoilt on several counts.

First, when the lights are on, the fluorescent world of the offices behind Terry's groomed facades blazes through unsympathetically. Second, the nicely proportioned Georgian sash windows are sealed. Third, the shops at ground level are of the sort you might find in any suburban development. Fourth, details like door numbers and letter boxes look as if they are out of a run-of-the-mill house builders' catalogue.

Fifth, the architectural wrap is a little too fancy for Baker Street. The brick bits look good from a distance, but the Portland stone slice of the facade is out of place. It belongs to a provincial town with pretensions, not architecturally assured London. It is like a 1980s banker in a loud suit trying to mingle with old-fashioned gents about town.

However, there are virtues. Where many modern office blocks give way to slummy backs hiding wheelie bins and extractor fans, Terry's is civilised and well-detailed. That the block includes three restored Georgian town houses is also encouraging. Perhaps this is due to planning. But it is good that a new office development has not been allowed to gobble up every last inch of a city block in the ungodly pursuit of profit from acres of lettable and witless space.

There is, though, something else that he and his clients might like to consider. This month marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of Sir John Soane (1753-1837), one of the most inventive of all classical revival architects. He has proved in his own work and that of generations of architects who have borrowed from him, that the classical language of architecture is flexible and profound.

There is no reason why architects should avoid the treasury of classicism, but there are many reasons why they, and their clients, should avoid classical fancy dress. Terry and God might want to go back to their drawing boards: for this building on Baker Street is designed to serve Mammon.","A state-of-the-art office block that looks like a row of Georgian town houses?

Armed militia stormed and occupied a national wildlife building in Oregon on Friday.

The occupation happened after 300 militia and local citizens protested the ruling that two ranchers, father and son Dwight Hammond Jr. and Steven, will be returning to prison on Monday, according to

One of the occupiers, Ammon Bundy, told the newspaper that they're not looking to hurt anyone, but if it might come to that if police try to remove them. They broke into the refuge's unoccupied building and have refused to leave.

""We're planning on staying here for years, absolutely,"" Bundy told the news outlet in a phone interview. ""This is not a decision we've made at the last minute.

""The best possible outcome is that the ranchers that have been kicked out of the area, then they will come back and reclaim their land, and the wildlife refuge will be shut down forever and the federal government will relinquish such control,"" he said.

""What we're doing is not rebellious. What we're doing is in accordance with the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land.""

that the Hammond family are not taking part in the take-over.

""Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond Family,"" the Hammonds' lawyer W. Alan Schroeder reportedly wrote to Sheriff David Ward, according to the news station.

that Steven Hammond was seen greeting protesters with his wife before the take-over took place.

, Bundy is the 40-year-old son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy who drew national attention last year after staging a standoff with federal authorities after a Bureau of Land Management dispute.

Bundy, along with his two brothers, are supporting a pair of ranchers who will be beginning their second federal prison term on an arson conviction,

The militia groups are protesting a judge's ruling that the two ranchers served too little time for setting fires that spread to government lands they leased to graze cattle.

According to CBS, Cliven said he wasn't part of the new protest.

""That's not exactly what I thought should happen, but I didn't know what to do,"" he said. ""You know, if the Hammonds wouldn't stand, if the sheriff didn't stand, then, you know, the people had to do something. And I guess this is what they did decide to do. I wasn't in on that.""

KTVZ reports that the Hammonds said they lit the fires in 2001 and 2006 to reduce the growth of invasive plants and protect their property from wildfires. They were convicted of the arsons three years ago and although they served time, a judge ruled that under federal law they must return to prison and serve another four years each.

""I'm going to prison for five years for 127 acres? Seems like a bit of an overkill to me,"" Dwight Hammond told reporters outside his home on Saturday. ""It isn't my decision, obviously. It's a sentence.""

Dwight has said he and his son plan to peacefully report to prison Jan. 4 as ordered by the judge.",The participants said they were hoping the sheriff would stand up against the federal government and protect the father-and-son who will be reporting to prison on Monday,20.0,0.8387096774,1.8064516129000001,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

They made highlight-reel plays and took ASU's high-powered offense to new heights.

This year, expectations are even higher. They are another year older, wiser and more familiar with one another, and the offense is expected to carry a team replacing nine defensive starters.

But as much as Kelly and Strong have connected on the field, the teammates have spent just as much energy building connections in the community away from the field.

ASU has team-wide community service initiatives, but some players go above and beyond. Kelly, who is approaching his third season as ASU's starter, can be counted among them. His extra efforts have earned him back-to-back nominations for the American Football Coaches Association's Good Works Team, which recognizes volunteerism and leadership.

Through ASU's Scholar Baller leadership and outreach program, Kelly has mentored students at multiple area high schools and a charter school for at-risk students. Kelly received his B.A. in education in May.

""We'll just go in and talk to them about how important school is and education is, that you don't need to portray an image to be cool and fit in,"" Kelly said.

Beyond those organized activities, though, Kelly has made extra efforts to connect with the community. Last year, he attended a Saturday morning youth football practice on his own time because he'd met an older classmate's children and wanted to see them play.

Most memorable for Kelly was a visit with a family he had been introduced to by his younger sister. The family included a young boy who had undergone multiple brain surgeries and didn't do much more than sit up in bed for 15 minutes or so. When Kelly visited, the boy was up and about, smiling and talking about ASU football for a few hours.

""That stuff takes no energy on my part, and it means the world to those kids,"" Kelly said. ""I love doing that type of stuff and plan on doing it the rest of my life.

That kind of commitment to community must have rubbed off on Strong, who roomed with Kelly in fall camp and on the road last year. Strong has participated in ASU's Scholar Baller efforts at the same schools as Kelly and followed Kelly's lead in making trips to Phoenix Children's Hospital.

On Wednesday, Strong spent a few hours at the hospital. He played video games with a young patient named Isaac before stopping by the cancer ward to talk ASU football with a boy named Mario.

""He knows everything about ASU football,"" Strong said. ""He's a real good kid. It humbled me a lot meeting him.

""You just look at those kids, and every day for them is a hard day. A good day for them, we might consider one of the worst of our lives. That humbled me a lot.""

While Kelly and Strong have a shared appreciation for the importance of building bonds in the community, it's their connection on the field that garners national acclaim. Over the past week, both have been named to multiple preseason award watch lists, adding to already high expectations for the coming season.

Strong got to ASU late last summer after transferring from Pierce College in Los Angeles. He'd been communicating with Kelly since he committed the previous December, and when he arrived, Kelly immediately began showing him the way.

""Since the first day I stepped on campus he's been a big brother to me,"" Strong said. ""He showed me the ropes. Every day we'd talk about coverages or offense or how to read plays more quickly. Taylor's taught me everything.""

That relationship translated quickly to the field, and the pair connected 75 times, seven for touchdowns, as Strong racked up 1,122 receiving yards. Both earned All-Pac-12 Second Team honors, and Strong established himself as one of the conference's best receivers.

""I have confidence if I put it anywhere in his vicinity he's going to go up and snag it,"" Kelly said. ""It's a weird bond that we have, and it happened so fast.""

That confidence is mutual -- Strong knows Kelly will get the ball within reach -- and it grew from hours of film study, afternoons of independent practice sessions and simply getting to know each other better.

""He's quiet and I'm quiet,"" Strong said. ""When we first moved in we would talk, but we both like our peace and quiet. So we'd both have headphones in, or we could watch a whole football game and neither one of us would talk about it until a big play.""

The pair's friendship has grown a great deal since then, and they believe their relationship on the field will grow just as much.

""The sky's the limit for it,"" Kelly said. ""We have worked really hard this offseason just watching film together, seeing different coverages. Even our timing on routes -- we've been throwing every single day.""

Kelly and Strong have already established themselves within the ASU football community as impact players. While this season offers the opportunity to do so even more, both hope their eventual legacies in Tempe include the work they've done to support the community that supports them on Saturdays.

""I want to leave the ASU campus and program a better place than when I got here, and that involves the community,"" Kelly said. ""I would still do this stuff even if I wasn't involved with football.""

The world-famous architect was signed on to design a $154m concert hall campus for the New World Symphony Orchestra in early 2003. But city commissioners, now $2m over budget, have asked Michael Tilson Thomas, the orchestra's founder and artistic director (and lifelong friend of the architect), to get Gehry to agree on a fee cut or face being replaced. The costs for an additional sculptural park planned to surround the hall have reportedly spiralled, and a fully fledged spat between the architect and his clients has been thrashed out in the press.

Gehry argued that the $10m the city expected to pay for the park was an unrealistically low sum and that if they wanted a smaller, lesser, park then he wouldn't stop them hiring someone else. ""I really find it insulting,"" Gehry told the Miami Herald before quitting the project. ""If they keep messing with me, if I get insulted enough, I'll withdraw completely."" Adding fuel to the fire, he said, was the worldwide request issued by the city for an architect to replace him on the park design while he still officially held the job.

So, Gehry is off the project, and the city of Miami Beach is the world's first to mess with an architect who has a knack for raising city profiles sky-high. Gehry, however, is hardly the first architect to become embroiled in the kind of spat that goes down in architectural history books. The ghost of the brilliant Danish architect, Jørn Utzon, must surely haunt Sydney Opera House. This charismatic building, a symbol of Australia since its opening in 1973, was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2007, ranking it in terms of global and historical significance alongside Stonehenge, Chartres Cathedral and the Great Wall of China. But in the mid-1960s when Utzon was working to build this complex and mesmerising structure, his career was in the hands of Davis Hughes, the New South Wales government minister for public works. Hughes didn't care much for architecture and much less for some intellectual, artistic foreigner with a funny name who probably couldn't tell the difference between Fosters and XXXX bitter. Within a year of being appointed in 1965, Hughes had caused Utzon, who was owed A$100,000 in fees and unable to pay his team, to resign.

The great architect was never to return to Australia, although late in life he submitted designs for new interiors (now in place), which were asked for by the Sydney Opera House Trust a few years before he died in 2008. Even then, the defiant former minister declared: ""There's obviously a need to upgrade the place, but why do we need Utzon? Why can't we get a competent Sydney architect?"" Strewth.

Christopher Wren, Britain's most famous architect, was treated in an equally cavalier fashion by the Davis Hughes of his era during the construction of St Paul's Cathedral between 1675 and 1711. The conservative church commissioners in charge of the project had wanted a spindly, gothic church tricked up on the cheap, with some token Renaissance frills. Wren managed to turn an early design they approved of into the noble building we see today: gothic in plan, baroque in spirit and crowned with one of the world's finest domes.

During the long years of building, however, Wren was wrongly accused of corruption and his salary was cut in half. He was also stripped of his title of chief surveyor. He did, however, live to see his greatest work completed - St Paul's and Wren's reputation remain evergreen.

Further down the line, John Vanbrugh fell out with his client, the Duchess of Marlborough, over the cost of completing Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. The site was supposed to be a national memorial funded by a grateful nation in honour of the Duke of Marlborough, the feted British general. But, no proper contract was ever drawn up between the crown and Vanbrugh and when payments from the state dried up, the Marlboroughs had to pay their own way. The Duchess curbed what she saw as Vanbrugh's excesses and finally, threw him off the project. He was later seen trying to peer over the mighty walls of Blenheim to get a look at the glorious palace he had designed, when it was finally completed in 1725.

Adolf Loos was another talent thrown off mid-project (albeit temporarily in this case). Loos's Goldman & Salatsch building overlooking Vienna's Michaelerplatz was not considered extravagant enough. In fact, the building – a mix of beautifully realised showrooms, offices and apartments – caused a scandal in decorous Vienna and was likened in the press of the time to ""a granary"".

Loos fell ill with worry, but while on a break in Italy trying to recover, he read in the papers that an official committee led by professors Koenig and Baumann had been set up to redesign his austere facades. Loos raced back to Vienna where he addressed a public crowd, two thousand strong, in defence of his design. In the event, this pugnacious architect agreed to add bronze window boxes to the front of the building, and so add a little colour where he had wanted only unadulterated white plaster. Today, of course, the Loos building on Michaelerplatz is considered a national treasure. A full list of architectural feuds would keep this website busy for months, but as long as architecture truly matters we will continue to argue about what buildings should look like, how much they should cost and whether or not their architects are extravagant wastrels. In the vast majority of cases, however, we come to revere the works of talented architects caught up in a world of dim politics and personal vainglory that seem, in the light of years, very small beer indeed compared with the fine vintages of Adolf Loos, John Vanbrugh, Christopher Wren, Jørn Utzon, and Frank Gehry.","Jonathan Glancey: As Frank Gehry falls out with Miami planners, Jonathan Glancey looks at other serious architectural rows that threatened buildings such as the Sydney Opera House and St Paul's Cathedral",33.9117647059,0.6470588235,1.4705882353,medium,low,abstractive,architecture

An assortment of strange concrete forms stand in a sunken pit at the foot of the Balfron Tower in east London – a little tableau of walls, ramps and an odd lookout tower that could be the fenced-off ruins of some ancient civilisation. The civilisation in question was known as the welfare state, and this was one of its playgrounds, lying at the base of what was once a great slab of social housing designed by Hungarian emigre architect Ernő Goldfinger. The building is now being scrubbed up before being sold off as luxury brutalist apartments.

“The tower itself might have been saved, but we’re interested in what happens to the landscapes around these postwar housing estates, and what they represent,” says Jane Hall of young architecture collective Assemble, the group recently announced as a wildcard entry on the Turner prize shortlist. They are currently rebuilding full-sized chunks of these brutalist playgrounds inside the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, in one of the most radical exhibitions ever staged in the prim surrounds of its Portland Place HQ.

Goldfinger’s lookout platform now pokes through the ceiling of the gallery, popping up into a skylight to provide an unusual, worm’s-eye perspective on the RIBA’s backyard. Reached by scampering up some steps and crawling through a tunnel, from where a slide whisks you back down, it also gives a vantage point down into the gallery space, now filled with an assortment of curious bits and pieces sampled from other estates in London, forming a brutalist bricolage of soft play.

In a brilliant move of material alchemy – typical of Assemble, who often spend months tracking down samples and developing new materials – the bush-hammered concrete that is so synonymous with these brutalist structures has been substituted by reconstituted foam, with a grain of squishy coloured chunks that matches the mix of rocks and pebbles in the gnarled concrete aggregate.

“It’s a sort of in-joke,” says fellow Assembler Joe Halligan, “that in order for these postwar structures to meet current safety standards, everything has to be squidgy.”

Squidgy brutalism, it turns out, also comes in a gentle pastel palette of pale pink, blue and green – the cushioning industry’s standard colours for denoting the foam’s density, which are usually hidden behind covers of wipe-clean vinyl in lurid primary shades. Left exposed here, it transforms the estates’ hard-edged, knee-grazing terrain of cement, brick and tiles into an innocuous, candy-coloured world, consciously removed from the negative associations of stained concrete and failed utopias that have become ingrained in the public psyche. Shed of such connotations and transposed into a Mr Soft universe, the playful power of these landscapes can be seen afresh, freed from political baggage.

“We’re not passing comment on whether we think these brutalist playgrounds were good or bad,” says Hall. “But it’s about how attitudes to play have changed. Today we have so many specialist play designers that architects don’t really get involved.”

“In the examples we’ve looked at,” Halligan adds, “the playgrounds are often an offshoot of the architecture. It’s the stuff Goldfinger couldn’t do on the tower, so he let his mind go wild in the playground. I don’t know how much he actually thought about how good it would be to play on – which is the beauty of it really.” Fenced off for decades, deemed unsafe due to the prospect of crumbling concrete falling from the tower, the Balfron playground has become a popular spot for free-runners and skaters, who are happy to make use of its steep ramps and lethal drops.

These landscapes were the product of an era when children were used to playing in the accidental playgrounds provided by bomb sites, appropriating the ruins of wartime devastation for adventurous fun and games. While today’s sanitised playgrounds are full of risk-averse equipment made for designated play activities, the postwar attitude was often more of an imaginative make-do-and-mend, building unusual, often purposeless structures that could then be played on, in and under, and inhabited as children saw fit. They were places for them to make their own.

It’s a theme Assemble have picked up in their own work, from a public square in Croydon’s New Addington estate, featuring ramps and ledges for skaters that were initially developed using temporary structures to gauge how people would use the space, to a wild adventure playground in Glasgow’s East End, built from the rubble of the Commonwealth Games.

Of the postwar period, perhaps no estate playground was as weird and wonderful as the one at the centre of the Churchill Gardens estate in Pimlico, central London. Churchill Gardens was one of many social housing schemes proposed by the ambitious Abercrombie plan for rebuilding London after the second world war, but ultimately the only one that was realised. It was built between 1946 and 1962 to designs by Powell and Moya. Featuring crenellated castles with spiralling staircases leading down to dungeons, along with rope walkways and a concrete ocean liner, the playground had as its centrepiece a gigantic flying saucer, tipped at a precipitous angle and accessed by an outcrop of hexagonal blocks shaped like the basalt columns of the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland.

The five metre-wide disc has now been faithfully rebuilt in the centre of the RIBA gallery, supported by a half-tonne steel frame clad in green foam and finished off with a bright yellow balustrade. There will also be 40 hexagonal foam basalt blocks for visitors to sit on and build their own structures with, along with a surreal soundscape running through the installation produced by Halligan – who has a small recording studio at Assemble’s Stratford HQ and is currently in the process of setting up a record label, Sugarhouse Records.

“It’s a bit like the playgrounds are getting their own back,” says photographer Simon Terrill, who lives in the Balfron Tower and collaborated on the project. His photos of postwar estates, along with images from the RIBA archive, are projected across one wall of the gallery. “Before, they were dominated by the buildings around them, but here it’s the playgrounds that really overwhelm the architecture.”

Intentionally designed to feel almost too big for the space, the fragments – which also include a series of terraced ledges and ramps sampled from the Brunel estate in Paddington – have all been remade at full scale, measured from archive drawings and photographs since most of them are no longer standing.

“We were inspired by walking through the V&A cast courts,” says Halligan, “and the idea that these precious things from around the world would be copied and rebuilt in the museum at full size, as a sign of their value.” He adds that contemporary playgrounds in housing developments are all too often the result of Section 106 payments, the “planning gain” tax that developers reluctantly pay to local authorities for added community benefits. And the results are often as dispiriting as the procurement process would suggest.

By lovingly remaking these forgotten structures from a lost era of socially minded housing estates, Assemble have highlighted the value such places can bring, with a dose of wit and charm. And they’ll really have achieved something if they can convince some of the older members of the RIBA to take off their shoes and have a tumble.

It looks like a real operation. But the “patient” is a toddler-size mannequin, and the operating room a makeshift space of brown cardboard.

The setting was a 40,000-square-foot “cardboard city,” a mock-up of a new building that Boston Children’s Hospital is planning for its Longwood Medical Area campus. The simulated surgery was part of an exercise by hospital executives and architects to test the most efficient use of space.

At 11 stories and a half-million square feet, the new building will be the largest expansion in the hospital’s history: 150 patient beds, a dozen operating rooms, a pediatric heart center, and a bigger intensive care unit for newborns.

The expansion plan includes renovating other Longwood properties and adding hospital beds to the outpatient clinic in Waltham. Executives said patient growth is strong enough to justify the $1.5 billion expansion.

“Twenty years from now, we don’t want to be in the same position we are in today, which is not enough space,” said Melissa Burke, director of operations for the simulator program. “We’re doing this to make sure we make good decisions about how to design these spaces, make optimal use of the real estate, and have very efficient workflow.”

One of the big challenges of constructing a hospital building in Boston is the shortage of land.

“Real estate is so expensive,” Burke said. “The standard hospital room can be much bigger in a place like Texas. Here, every inch of space is critical.”

The cardboard setup allows clinicians to move doorways, walls, and equipment around while they consider how big the doors should be, for example, which way patients should be facing, and where to place the many trays of surgical tools. Such details are critical, clinicians say, during complex medical procedures, which require that both personnel and tools be optimally placed.

Shepley Bulfinch, the Boston firm designing the building, has created cardboard hospital mock-ups before, but not one where doctors and nurses ran simulations of medical scenarios.

“This will be really helpful in the design process,” said Andre Kamili, an architect at Shepley Bulfinch. “If you just do a paper design, you will find something doesn’t work. Doing it this way is actually cost-saving.”

Children’s spent more than $75,000 to build the cardboard city and run three days of simulations. The hospital said the cost was small, compared to the benefits of an efficient space, such as the potential for fewer medical complications.

The simulations this week began with briefings of doctors, nurses, and other clinicians, who then went quickly to their stations in the cardboard operating rooms as if responding to a real medical situation. They stopped after each mock procedure to discuss the experience.

“How does this room feel?” Dr. Catherine Allan, clinical director of the simulator program, asked a member of the surgical team. After several minutes of back-and- forth, the team moved the cardboard walls and equipment around to see if another configuration felt more comfortable.

“It’s extremely important we do this as we build a facility for the next 30, 40 years,” said Dr. Aditya “A.K.” Kaza, a cardiac surgeon who participated in the exercises.

“Things look great on paper until you bring the patient in and see maybe there’s a better way.”

Clinicians reposition sections of the “cardboard city” to find the optimum operating room layout during a mock exercise.","Boston Children’s Hospital held a series of mock surgeries this week in a 40,000-square-foot “cardboard city,” a mock-up of a hospital building Children’s is planning to begin constructing next year.",17.925,0.875,5.975,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

William Blake lived here, his name commemorated in a low-key council estate running parallel to the railway viaduct that leads south and west through the badlands of Waterloo.

Shoehorned between railway tracks, 18th-century cottages and housing estates is one of the best new apartment blocks in Britain, a minor masterpiece that will surely make the reputation of its architects dRMM (de Rijke Marsh Morgan). It points the way to the kind of compact housing our cities need, but which so many of our architects and house-builders find difficult to achieve.

The apartment block, One Centaur Street, rises four storeys from what had seemed a very unpromising site, a narrow strip of land that had been a scrapyard for many years. The prince of Centaur Street is Roger Zogolovitch, architect, developer and course director of the London School of Economics' cities programme. Zogolovitch has put his own money into this building and, although it is a commercial concern, he is unlikely to reap much profit. This, however, is not the point: One Centaur Place is a prototype for intelligent and elegant city housing that could happily be repeated, and profitably so.

""If the planners had agreed,"" says Alex de Rijke,""we could have continued the design up to as many as 20 storeys. Of course, this was impossible in this particular location, but the idea of the building is that it can be recreated in any number of patterns: higher, lower, using different colours and finishes and with different internal layouts.

""The cost of this kind of block would fall if we were able to build several at once but, in any case, we have made as much use as possible of prefabricated and off-the-shelf components to keep costs down. This is also an aesthetic we like.""

A solid concrete block is clad in a form of contemporary clapboard. What might be taken for old railway sleepers bolted along the walls turn out to be dark, concrete sections animating all four sides of the building. Set close together at its base, they grow wider apart as the building pops its head above the railway viaduct, causing the block to lighten as it rises into the London sky.

This clever, yet restrained, use of materials continues throughout the building. De Rijke and his partners, Philip Marsh and Sadie Morgan, have created their own vocabulary of materials, playing intelligently with unusual woods and tiles offset by finely finished concrete, glass and industrial components.

The great thing about this residential building is that it is a hybrid, fusing, as de Rijke points out, ""the European horizontal apartment and the English vertical terraced house"". In practice, this means that each of the light and thoughtfully planned flats is arranged on several levels connected by a contemporary take on the traditional, narrow London staircase. The effect is of living in a small, sunlit house inside an apartment block. The block, seen as a single entity from the outside, is rather like a Rubik cube inside.

There is nothing tricky or quaint here: the building is an unpretentious architectural ship berthed in a tight London dock. It boasts balconies on all floors: recessed on its sunny south side, projecting on to the street on its north side.

Its top deck (roof terraces for the penthouse flats) is contained by Key-Klamp railings, the sort you expect to find guarding zebra crossings outside school gates. These penthouses would be ideal city pads for railway buffs: the view here is like looking down on a train set, with the backdrop of the Palace of Westminster and the London Eye.

Below, residents will share a garden made of concrete and old timber railway sleepers, adorned with magnolia trees and lined with honeysuckle, willowherb (a railway plant), busy Lizzie and London pride. The architects are so pleased with the building that they have bought the ground floor to use as their office. The other flats are for sale.

It is curious that buildings like this are so rare. We have all but forgotten how to build compact city housing so intelligently. The 18th-century terrace that paces along the side of One Centaur Street is a perfect (and perfectly average) example of the type of handsomely proportioned, plain English housing that developers used to run up in their tens of thousands. Whatever street they occupy, they always look good. Cheap to build, easy to repair, flexible in use, they have stood the test of time and continue to define the look of so much of London and other cities. A grim 1970s (possibly 1980s) housing block jostling for attention elsewhere in this mix is an example of where we have gone wrong. With its tiny windows, childish play of materials, tiny pitched roofs and general toytown aesthetic, it is far better suited to a cul-de-sac an hour down the line from Waterloo than a street where Blake once walked and some of the greatest poetry in the English language was written.

We seem to have no problem with converting old buildings into modern flats, but find the design of the modern equivalent of old London terraced housing difficult. Who is to blame? Planners? Architects? House builders? House buyers? Possibly a poorly informed alliance of all four. It is difficult for house buyers to make proper choices or get their voices heard in the city housing market. It is only when there are examples to look at, such as One Centaur Street, that any of us can see what a desirable yet low-cost modern city home might be like. London is a city built largely by developers, although much of its finest, cheaper homes were designed and paid for by public bodies like the munificent old London County Council (1889-1965).

What our cities need is developers with the intelligent concern and willingness to take risks of Roger Zogolovitch, the talents of architects like dRMM and local authority officers keen to create a new generation of popular housing free of sentimentality, kitsch detailing and wilfully anti-urban design. Standing alongside one of the busiest main line railways in Europe, One Centaur Place might not be everyone's choice, but as a pointer to the standard of city housing we can easily have if we want it, it is all but peerless.

As the title suggests, the in-house publication celebrates the dawning of a new era of architectural enlightenment for the nation's broadcaster, and its introduction paints scenarios of contented workers, enthralled punters and phoenixes rising from ashes, all within the next couple of years. ""The BBC has found its nerve again and risen to its role as national champion and patron of the arts,"" writes Dan Cruickshank, in the book's foreword, ""and in the last three years [it] has commissioned a series of major buildings that suggest an artistic renaissance is taking place within the corporation."" Leading the way are three flagship buildings commissioned from three of Britain's top architects: a revamp of its jewel-in-the-crown Broadcasting House in London by Sir Richard MacCormac; a smart new BBC Scotland centre in Glasgow by David Chipperfield Architects; and the forward-looking Music Box, a home for the BBC's orchestras at its White City HQ in west London, by rising stars Foreign Office Architects.

The plans were universally applauded at the time; the BBC was even named ""Client of the Year"" by the Royal Institute Of British Architects (Riba) Journal. But looking around today, that refound nerve seems to have been re-lost. Nothing has been done about the Music Box and the project is now in doubt, David Chipperfield has been replaced as executive architect in Scotland and most dramatic of all, in October, MacCormac's firm, MacCormac Jamieson Prichard (MJP), was unceremoniously removed from the £800m Broadcasting House scheme halfway through.

One person who could explain what's going on is Richard MacCormac, but under the terms of his departure, he's forbidden from talking about it. The BBC's side has been opaque to say the least. It issued two short statements, one citing ""creative differences"" and stressing that ""this is in no way a reflection of their opinion of the professional capabilities of MacCormac Jamieson Prichard whom they continue to view with the highest regard"". The other announced that a new architect, Sheppard Robson, has been brought in to ""develop and deliver the original design"". Officially, the BBC's press spokesperson says: ""Broadcasting House is by Sir Richard MacCormac. He has designed it. The fact is that he is no longer the architect of it. It's still Sir Richard MacCormac's building that's going up. It's half up already, you can't change it. It's there.""

So has the BBC bottled it? Or has it simply given some of those profligate architects a harsh lesson in budget management? The BBC has hardly been forthcoming about these expensive schemes - understandable, perhaps, considering the regular bashings it has had in recent years - but isn't it fair to ask what, exactly, it has been doing with the vast sums of the public's money earmarked for these buildings?

Broadcasting House was always going to be a difficult project. The scheme called for a complete refit of the existing 1930s building in Portland Place, demolition of the post-1960s chaos that has grown around it and new state-of-the-art offices and studios to house all of the corporation's news and radio operations, including the world's largest newsroom. And all of this without interrupting day-to-day broadcasting, on a confined site bounded by tube lines below, height restrictions above and a Grade I listed church right next door. MacCormac, a past president of Riba and one of Britain's most respected and cultured architects, was by all accounts the man for the job. His elegant, curving extension seamlessly fused with the old building, sensitively blending materials and creating a new public plaza facing Oxford Street and a dramatic, telegenic space for the newsroom behind.

But having won the limited competition in 2000 and the difficult planning permission this year, MacCormac's design has reportedly been under siege ever since. Despite more than 300 design changes requested by the client, MJP stuck with the project through its first phase - the refit of the original Broadcasting House and a new wing alongside it - which has recently been completed. But according to sources, MacCormac preferred to walk rather than sacrifice key features of phase two, such as the grand, sculptural pillars he had designed for the newsroom, the double-height ""breakout spaces"" intended to encourage inter-departmental mingling and a blue-glass wall running through the building, separating public and office zones.

""The very elements which won MJP the project in the first place, and which were known about and meant to be costed properly, are the elements that have been value-engineered out, which is a euphemism for cost cutting,"" says one insider. ""Richard is devastated. It's a tremendous blow, artistically, professionally, financially, everything.""

David Chipperfield, meanwhile, appears to have been having a similar experience north of the border. His firm won the competition for the £72m BBC Scotland headquarters in Glasgow's Pacific Quays around the time MacCormac was getting started. Chipperfield's solution to a similarly challenging brief is a minimal glass box, containing a giant staircase inside that's more like a series of platforms ascending through an atrium. Like MacCormac, in August 2004 Chipperfield was removed as executive architect; the difference is that he is still working on the project. ""Our role was taken over by another firm without our agreement,"" he says. ""We have agreed to be retained in a sort of advisory role. We can only say, 'Look, it can be done this way.' It's not going to be the building we designed but I still think it's probably going to be a decent building.""

As for the Music Box, Foreign Office is still on good terms with the BBC, according to its co-director, Farshid Moussavi, but the project hasn't moved at all since it was appointed in 2003. ""There is no time frame that we know of,"" she says, ""but we have been told the intention is still to do it. We're still optimistic.""

To have one high-profile architectural scheme in peril is a misfortune, but to have three at the same time looks like carelessness. And while nobody really wants to give a treasured cultural institution a good kicking, it is fair to ask what is really going on - especially since the BBC itself has hardly been forthcoming. If there is one problem linking these schemes, it is the way the BBC now runs its property division. There used to be an in-house department with its own team of architects dealing with property, but in 2001, in a £2.5bn deal, the BBC transferred much of its responsibility and most of its staff to the private company Land Securities Trillium. Under the new contract, Land Securities took on 65 or so BBC buildings across the country, as well as the duty of financing and developing the corporation's new projects, which it would then rent back to them. Unions likened the deal to ""selling the family silver"", but from the BBC's point of view it was a shrewd move, if a desperate one. Long gone were the glory days that produced finely crafted buildings like Broadcasting House, or even functional ones such as Television Centre in Shepherd's Bush.

The point when the BBC originally lost its nerve was probably the 80s, when a bold new headquarters was commissioned for the site across the road from Broadcasting House, from the then rising star Norman Foster. It would have been a revolutionary building, thrillingly high-tech but transparent and unifying. However, after a changing of the BBC guard, the new chairman and ex-Tesco director Stuart Young plumped instead to site the new HQ in a crass tin shed in White City, which is widely regarded as one of the ugliest buildings in the land.

By that time the BBC's property estate across the country was in a pretty shabby state, and with the corporation having to fight for public cash just to make programmes, there was little chance of a government-funded overhaul. By contrast, the deal with Land Securities freed up cash for programming and transferred the risk of building the BBC's ambitious projects on to the private sector.

The BBC was a notoriously difficult client even before it adopted this outsourcing strategy, according to architects. Its buildings invariably involve several different departments, whose competing and fluctuating demands can be exasperating. But under the new arrangement, the BBC is no longer, technically, the client at all. Instead, architects such as MacCormac and Chipperfield must answer to Land Securities and its contractors, Bovis Lend Lease. And their primary responsibility is to deliver value for money.

""In each case our aim has been to control the selection of the architects, control the evolution of the design up to a certain point, but then hand over to the builder to deliver it to us, but deliver it on time and on budget,"" explains John Smith, the BBC's chief operating officer and the man who devised the outsourcing strategy. ""Imagine how we would be berated if instead we said to any architect or builder that was working for us, 'Don't care about the budget. Just do what you want and we'll just say yes to everything.' We have an obligation to the licence-fee payer to deliver it on time and on budget.""

""On time and on budget"" has become the mantra for the BBC and many other public sector builders. Having seen the costs of schemes such as the Scottish Parliament and Wembley Stadium spiral conspicuously out of control, the BBC is understandably exercising extreme caution. Smith points to examples where private-sector partnerships have paid off, such as award-winning regional facilities in Northampton and Coventry, and particularly at the ""Media Village"" at White City - a new set of buildings around the original ""tin shed"". Under the management of Land Securities, architects Allies and Morrison delivered the latter on budget and slightly early.

But many have questioned whether the flagship projects could ever have been delivered under similar arrangements. ""I know Richard felt very strongly about this way of procuring the building,"" says one architect close to the Broadcasting House scheme. ""But this is the norm now, you have to apply the market and rigid criteria to everything. So even though this was a once-in-a-hundred-years building, for arguably Britain's most important cultural institution, it still has to be procured as if it was just a commercial office block around the corner.""

""That's preposterous,"" counters Smith. ""You've only got to go and have a look at it. Just go and look at the amount of effort that's being made. It's not our approach that's at fault, but you have to marry a budget and a timetable with the architectural vision. You can't simply always allow the desire for architectural finesse in every single manifestation right to the end. You have to make a trade-off, and it works well nearly all the time.""

In May of this year, the BBC scrapped its 30-year deal with Land Securities, 26 years early. An external audit into the deal had concluded that ""the vision established at the outset has not been fully realised,"" and that ""maximum possible value is not being achieved."" The press called it ""a humiliating collapse""; a BBC spokesman prefers to couch it in terms of more favourable interest rates becoming available on the bond market, like shopping around for a better deal on your new kitchen. Either way, Land Securities banked a £23m profit by selling the White City media village back to the BBC, plus £16m in compensation. And until the BBC re-tenders the deal next year, it has an off-balance-sheet debt of £1.2bn.

The last thing the BBC is really looking for is adverse publicity, but in the case of its architectural strategy the situation seems to have been compounded by heavy pressure on the corporation to demonstrate value for money in everything it does. What alternatives did the BBC have? Would it have earned sympathy for doing nothing about the state of its properties? Or taking money out of programme-making? Or simply giving its architects more leeway?

The architectural community has made a few constructive suggestions. In a letter to the Architects' Journal, John McAslan suggested the BBC consider employing two architects at the outset: a signature visionary like MacCormac or Chipperfield and an ""architect of record"" to handle the nuts and bolts of the project. The process is commonly deployed in the US and was also used for Britain's Tate Modern, where Swiss stars Herzog & De Meuron did the big ideas, while the ""deliverability"" was taken care of by Sheppard Robson, the same firm now delivering Broadcasting House.

""I think what the BBC set out to do is a very difficult task,"" David Chipperfield sums up. ""They made grand statements and had grand ambitions and they were sincere about it. I don't think they've changed their minds, I don't think it was a conspiracy, I certainly don't think it was incompetence. But the reality of building and decision-making is very complex. It's not about money, it's about how you use that money. If I was to blame the BBC for anything, I think they underestimated what it takes to co-ordinate that process, certainly in our case, and I suspect to some degree that must also be true in the BBC Portland Place case. It would be more surprising for their plans to achieve fruition than for them to not quite achieve what they set out to achieve"".",When the BBC commissioned three landmark new buildings it was praised as a patron of cutting edge architecture. But now the architects of two of the projects have been dropped and the third may not even happen. What went wrong?

Fujimoto, 43, is standing in front of House NA, a jungle gym of white steel bars amid beige apartment buildings on a quiet street in Tokyo. Built on a tiny site of just about 600 square feet, it nonetheless incorporates 21 levels connected by angled ladders, with wooden boxes doubling as step stools. Gauzy white curtains provide privacy, but not a lot; the house is as much terrarium as shelter. The owners, a husband and wife drawn to unusual designs, “bought a small lot but got a lot of living space,” says Fujimoto. Those stairway substitutes would be illegal in most countries, but in Japan, there is little building-code enforcement within private homes, which gives Fujimoto the freedom to follow through on his sometimes confounding ideas.

Fujimoto’s goal isn’t just to make spaces—the basic function of architecture—but to make people relate to spaces in new ways. Watching the couple move around the house, approaching everyday activities with the finesse the unusual design requires, suggests he is well on his way to achieving it.

He concedes that his clients have accepted “some really extreme solutions” to their housing needs. But rather than make their lives difficult, he says, he hopes to bring people “some comfort that is yet unknown.” That comfort may derive in part from landscape elements that Fujimoto blends into his buildings. During a tour of his studio in Tokyo’s Shinjuku neighborhood, the architect points to dozens of model houses with tiny trees breaking through walls, floors and ceilings. In Fujimoto’s hands, nature sometimes overpowers the built environment, a vision that could be apocalyptic were it not for his highly refined aesthetic. “I call it primitive future,” he says of the natural-artificial mash-up he is pioneering.

This fall, one Fujimoto building will help draw attention to Miami’s Design District during Art Basel, while another, in one of Tokyo’s main shopping districts, will compete with dazzling structures by the likes of Toyo Ito and Herzog & de Meuron. In California, Ronald C. Nelson, the executive director of the Long Beach Museum of Art, has been working with Fujimoto on ways to give the museum, in what was once a Craftsman-style house, new visibility. “We want a signature piece that says, ‘Oh, my God, I’ve got to go over there,’ ” says Nelson, explaining his choice of Fujimoto.

In architecture schools around the world, Fujimoto’s disregard for the expected has made him something of a hero. And he has become a constant presence on the lecture circuit, speaking in somewhat broken English but showing images that are more confident than his quiet demeanor suggests.

About half of Fujimoto’s active projects are abroad, as far away as Chile, Greece, Spain and China. But the best known of his buildings are the Japanese houses, designed to challenge clients rather than coddle them. With their odd proportions and lack of orthodox enclosure, they don’t so much restrict movement, in Fujimoto’s view, as create opportunities to explore “more possibilities” for daily life. Some of his admirers see the houses as explorations into how people will live in the not-too-distant future, when space and privacy are scarce.

For every critic who views the houses as important architectural experiments, there are many more who simply love Fujimoto’s aesthetic. The lightness of his structures can be particularly compelling. The German critic Niklas Maak described Fujimoto’s House NA as “a built optical illusion,” adding, “You would be forgiven for thinking gravity has ceased to exert its pull.”

In Los Angeles, lawyer Dana Taschner was looking for an architect to design a retreat on a tricky (if spectacular) lot on Mulholland Drive, overlooking the Hollywood sign. And who better for a tricky lot than Fujimoto? Says Taschner, “More than just knowing how to approach difficulty, which he does all the time, Sou thinks out of the box to create mind-bending concepts.” The house the architect came up with—a kind of tunnel cutting through the ridge, with views in two directions, one through a glass swimming pool that serves as a watery lens—is brilliant, says Taschner, who hopes to show it to a design review board in November.

In Miami, the developer Craig Robins tapped Fujimoto to help relaunch his Design District as an upscale fashion destination. Fujimoto’s contribution, on one of the district’s most prominent sites, is a building for several high-end jewelers, with a facade of blue glass that Robins says resembles falling water. “I’m totally thrilled,” says Robins, who chose Fujimoto for the high-profile project because he is “likely to grow in importance over time”—a prediction he is qualified to make, considering that he gave Zaha Hadid a Design District commission in 2005. Like Fujimoto’s designs, the Iraqi-British architect’s ideas were once considered too difficult to turn into actual buildings. Now she has more than 40 projects in the works.

By contrast, Fujimoto has about a dozen active projects. In Tokyo, he is completing a mixed-use building in Omotesando, the world-class shopping district that is also a proving ground for architects, including several Pritzker Prize winners. The most famous Omotesando building may be Herzog & de Meuron’s Prada store, with its vertical moss garden and bubble windows. Not far away is Tod’s, by Toyo Ito, with a flat concrete facade that suggests the branches of a tree. The Christian Dior boutique, by the Tokyo firm SANAA, is an ethereal, translucent jewel box.

Even in such company, Fujimoto’s entry is likely to make a splash. The four-story building steps back from the street at several points, and each time it does part of the structure sprouts small trees, as if the building itself were lifting a forest into the sky—a kind of Escher print in which beams become trees become beams, in three dimensions.

The building is the latest step in Fujimoto’s goal to harmonize nature and architecture. He is intent on bringing nature itself, not images of nature, into the built environment. He achieves that by either making his buildings so minimal that existing natural elements still dominate or by making the buildings veritable planters, as in his Omotesando design.

On the campus of Musashino Art University, he surrounded his 65,000-square-foot library with columns of dark-stained timber behind glass. They are deliberately reflective, making it hard to tell where the trees end and the building begins. Inside, instead of walls, the building is composed of bookshelves reaching up to the ceiling, an endless grid that becomes its own kind of forest, with the verticals as tree trunks and the horizontals as branches.

With these gestures, he is attempting, he says, to merge the forest of his childhood, in rural Hokkaido, with the forest of his adulthood: the man-made thickets of 21st-century cities. “The complexity and richness of the forest, where I grew up, is a very big starting point for me,” he says. “Now I’m based in Tokyo, and Tokyo itself is like a forest—an organic order in an artificial situation.”

“Both spaces are formed by accumulations of big and small elements,” he says. “Realizing this, I came to believe that we must be able to move back and forth more freely between architecture and nature. And thus I started the quest to create a new living environment, which would be neither architecture nor nature but the integration of both.”

FUJIMOTO DIDN’T ALWAYS plan to be an architect, though he remembers being fascinated by the work of Antoni Gaudí as a child. During high school, he regarded Albert Einstein as the greatest mind of the 20th century. He enrolled at the University of Tokyo, planning to study physics, before deciding, he says, “that my brain was not powerful enough.” Believing that the great modernist architects—including Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier —were as innovative as any scientist, he decided to follow in their footsteps.

Still, after graduating with a degree in architecture, Fujimoto avoided the usual path of working for an established firm. He was afraid, he says, that his ideas would become watered down. “For five or six years, I was nothing,” he says flatly. His big break came when his father, a psychiatrist and hospital director, helped him win an important commission: a children’s psychiatric rehabilitation center, which he designed as a cluster of white cubes. It attracted media attention, giving his nascent career a boost.

It is a career that has yet to pay off, monetarily. Fujimoto and his wife, Yumiko, live modestly (she works as his office manager). He rented a tuxedo for their backyard wedding in 2009, he says, and hasn’t worn one since. Most days, he arrives at his office in jeans and a T-shirt, in stark contrast to older Japanese architects, who can be stiffly formal. Fujimoto’s only indulgence is a pair of metal-framed glasses from the Japanese brand 999.9, the same kind worn by Ito, whom he describes as “the first architect who actually found some talent in me” and as “a father figure.”

The office itself, a former workers’ dormitory on the top floor of a printing plant, is almost shabby. (The work space is on six, but the building’s elevator stops at five. Fujimoto isn’t complaining—after all, his own buildings ask far more of their users than to walk up a flight of stairs.) His two dozen or so full-time employees are joined by almost the same number of “open-desk interns”—architecture students or recent graduates from all over the world, drawn to Tokyo by Fujimoto’s reputation. They work 14 or more hours a day, often building one Styrofoam model after another, like sorcerer’s apprentices trying to keep up with a flood of ideas. The practice of using interns, who generally aren’t paid, is controversial in the architecture world, but Fujimoto says that it benefits both architects and students. Certainly, it helps him stay afloat.

If his employees work in close quarters, that doesn’t bother Fujimoto, whose work is often about doing more with less—about, as he puts it, fitting architecture to the human body. Toshiko Mori, a New York architect and the former chair of the architecture program at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, says Fujimoto has a gift for devising structures that “create small moments of connection.”

That was nowhere more evident than in the pavilion he designed for London’s Serpentine Galleries in 2013. Each year, the gallery commissions an architect to create an event space in Hyde Park. (Fujimoto is the youngest architect to receive the prestigious commission, which has been awarded to Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas and Hadid.) His novel design wove thousands of steel bars into a kind of high-tech hedge. Transparent disks, set on the bars at various levels, became steps, tables and chairs. It allowed visitors to shape their own experiences, at different levels, the way children might choose different perches on a tree. At the same time, the pixelated structure blurred the boundary between indoors and out.

When Fujimoto has an idea, he may use it more than once. In fact, he is hoping to build a 1,000-foot tower in Taichung, Taiwan, that bears a strong resemblance to his Serpentine Pavilion. The Taichung government hopes the scaled-up version will become a symbol of that city—a kind of cloudlike Eiffel Tower.

During an interview last year, the Japanese architecture writer Yoshio Futagawa kidded him about the practice. “I sometimes find you taking models from other projects and simply scaling them up for reuse,” Futagawa said. Unfazed, Fujimoto responded that he wasn’t plagiarizing. Rather, he said, “It’s like growing crops—watching the seeds transform through generations. I sift through them, picking up the ones that look interesting and throwing away those that are no good.”

The seeds go back to one of his first projects in Tokyo, a six-unit apartment building that appears to be a pile of houses, stacked irregularly in a nod to the chaotic urban environment. The contrast between the traditional elements—the building components look like Monopoly houses—and their untraditional use made photographers swoon. The project also established his reputation for using conventional elements in unconventional ways.

Another early effort was the Final Wooden House, consisting of thick blocks of cedar stacked and staggered to create what might be called a rectilinear cave. It was as dark as House NA is light, as earthbound as the latter is airy.

Somewhere between those two extremes, but no less pioneering, is House N, consisting of a box within a box within a box—three enclosures, each with large windows, cleverly offset to allow privacy. Fujimoto says the boxes compel playful engagement with the architecture. For example, he says, there is a typical bedroom, but there are also many other places to sleep, depending on your mood and on the weather.

Japanese dwellings have historically been flexible, with little furniture other than tatami mats, and shoji screen partitions to allow rooms to take on multiple configurations. When the West was building marble and gold-leaf edifices like Versailles, the Japanese were building paper palaces. By designing houses with sliding walls and interlocking spaces, Fujimoto isn’t defying Japanese tradition but reinventing it.

Even with the international acclaim his Serpentine Pavilion brought him, the self-effacing architect is still a novice at winning clients’ confidence. Last year, the owner of an estate in Connecticut asked him to come up with ideas for a pool house. Fujimoto sent two sketches, both of which the client nixed. Next time, he says, he would insist on a face-to-face meeting, where he could explain—and offer to modify—his proposals. Providing ideas free of charge, as he did for the Connecticut client, is hardly a sustainable business model. And he got paid “almost nothing” for designing the Serpentine Pavilion, though the gallery sold Fujimoto’s pavilion to the billionaire pharmaceutical heir Maja Hoffmann for an undisclosed sum.

Whether they’re lucrative or not, Fujimoto is attacking commissions with almost ferocious creativity. In his office, scale models of planned buildings are everywhere. While some of the concepts will never be realized, Fujimoto says, “the thoughts are there in your mind to enrich ideas in the future.” Besides, he adds, with everything that could go wrong, any completed project “must be the result of miracles.”

There’s no way to know yet how many miracles will occur, but if Fujimoto wanted to, he could charge admission to his impromptu “model museum.” There, on the sixth floor of a nondescript building, visitors would get a glimpse of architecture’s bold, primitive future.","Fujimoto’s designs eschew the predictable and often force viewers to relate to space in a new way, making the Tokyo-based architect a hero in his field.",95.9677419355,0.8387096774,1.4838709677000002,high,medium,abstractive,architecture

Based on the amount of damage caused by the third-party contractor, and the repairs required, PG&E and the California Highway Patrol anticipate re-opening Highway 101 by approximately 5 p.m. today.

As a result of the 9:30 p.m. incident impacting the towers, high-voltage power lines fell onto the highway, city streets and a pedestrian walkway. The damaged towers and fallen power lines stopped north- and southbound traffic on Highway 101 for several hours after the incident. Also, the incident caused a flicker or momentary outage on the Peninsula and in parts of San Francisco.

PG&E worked with first responders, including the CHP and local police and fire agencies, during the incident to make the area safe, resulting in no injuries. The CHP ordered occupants in several vehicles to shelter in place until PG&E could de-energize and ground the wires and make the area safe. PG&E appreciates the patience of those who remained in their cars and the good work of the CHP to keep these vehicle occupants safe.

PG&E had electric first responders on site within 10 minutes of the accident, and additional resources and crews from across Northern California were dispatched to the scene. Specialized equipment, personnel and vehicles are integral for a repair job of this magnitude on a primary artery of the electric system.

PG&E activated its incident command and two PG&E Mobile Command Vehicles were dispatched to manage PG&E’s response.

PG&E will need to repair or replace the damaged towers before restringing and energizing the wires.

Some important tips to remember when dealing with downed wires include:

Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is one of the largest combined natural gas and electric utilities in the United States. Based in San Francisco, with more than 20,000 employees, the company delivers some of the nation’s cleanest energy to nearly 16 million people in Northern and Central California.

The partnership meets at the intersection of urban design and mobility, which in turn is literally shaping cities of the future.

“We think about physical design, and Nelson/Nygaard thinks about how people move through spaces,” says Perkins + Will CEO Phil Harrison. “More than half of the world’s population now lives in cities. As urbanity and density increase, cities are asking themselves how to have the best, most vibrant areas to attract talent. Transportation is always an ingredient in those conversations, and with this merger, we are better equipped to engage in those conversations.”

Twenty-four of the 30 cheapest two-year fixed rates on the market for those with a 40pc deposit were offered by banks, and just six by building societies.

This pattern was repeated across three-year and five-year fixed rates. However, the split was a little more even for 10-year fixed-rates, with 17 of the top 30 offered by banks.

For buyers with 10pc deposits, the split is half-and-half: 15 of the 30 cheapest two and three-year and 14 of the cheapest five-year fixed rates were offered by banks. Ten-year fixed rates for small-deposit buyers were offered only by Nationwide and TSB, with the building society offering a much broader range of rates.

This reflects the fact that building societies tend to cater more for ""fringe"" borrowers - those with smaller deposits or more unusual financial situations, or who are over 65, while banks compete on price for more mainstream borrowers.

Nationwide, Leeds, Coventry and Skipton building societies were the lenders most often at the top of best-buy tables.

Nationwide offers the most competitive deals because it is a ""building society that behaves like a bank"", brokers say, and has other sources of income such as financial planning.

The mutual has already cut rates on a series of fixed rate mortgages, citing the Bank Rate cut as the reason.

Edward Checkley, of Private Finance mortgage brokers, said: ""The gap between banks and building societies does significantly widen as a consequence of base rate reduction.

""Plenty of building societies will only lend their savings deposit monies.

In Italy, politics can seem like a capricious game, one that has deeply influenced the country's approach to architecture, design and urban planning over the past 30 or 40 years. Meanwhile, Spain changes its political spots slowly, but when it does change direction, the cultural results have been as thrilling as they have been serious. Just look at what happened in Barcelona at the time of Gaudí; and look what's happened to architecture and design since the death of Franco.

In Italy politics poisons and restricts intelligent new architectural development. The proof is that this attractive and wealthy country, with its peerless cultural legacy, has produced very little in the way of home-grown, world-class architecture in the past quarter of a century.

You might ask what on Earth do the country's 100,000 architects do with themselves? Even though the populations of the two countries are more or less the same, there are three times as many architects in Italy as there are in Britain. Many go into politics, at both local and national level. Some make it in the film industry. Some cook, some teach, while others publish alluring design magazines, or design exquisite furniture, lamps and costly gewgaws for sale in glamorous, architect-designed Milan showrooms. And, of course, there is plenty of work in the heritage business.

Because major architectural projects are so very political, these have been handed over, as if on a plate, to foreign talents, innocent of, or untainted by internecine Italian politics. So, Norman Foster gets to design a major new quarter of Milan, and Zaha Hadid has designed Rome's intriguing new Museum of Contemporary Art, currently under construction. The list of famous foreign architects is as long as the galleries of the Vatican Museum.

The one and only Italian architect who has made it big - very big - on the international stage as well as on his own home turf, is Renzo Piano. By all accounts, the charming, talented and Genoese master architect is looked on as something of a ""foreigner"" in Italy. Lucky him.

What great and inventive latent architectural talent there is in Italy is often channelled into a lively design industry. Next month's Milan ""Triennale"" promises, as ever, to be an enjoyable, and even provocative, display of playful designs by contemporary and historic talents. The list of past masters includes the work of Gio Ponti, Vico Magistretti, Alessandro Mendini, Ettorre Sottsass, Mario Bellini among that of many architects whose names we rarely associate with distinguished buildings.

The situation in Spain could hardly be more different. Politics has been a deadly serious affair here for as long as anyone can remember. Or, just plain deadly. When Generalissimo Franco died in 1975, the country began a long and steady ascent from its ignominious role as a philistine fascist dictatorship into the strong and much respected democratic monarchy that it is today. There was much for architects to do. Entire cities, despised by Franco, such as Barcelona and Bilbao, had suffered decades of neglect and under-investment, while hundreds of miles of beautiful coastline had been despoiled by trashy tourist resorts and famously unfinished concrete hotels.

From the 1980s, Barcelona became a showcase of how to revitalise a once magnificent city that had fallen on hard times. A lively new cultural scene, together with a sudden flux of superb bars, restaurants and nightclubs, was matched and mirrored by a thoroughgoing plan, led for many years by the architect Oriol Bohigas, to raise the design standards, and so lift the spirits, of the city's public plazas.

Championed by the socialist mayor, Pasqual Maragall, who held office from 1982 to 1997, and was later elected president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Barcelona became an international byword for successful ""urban regeneration."" And, for better or worse, Maragall and the experience of Barcelona in the 80s and 90s, are very much a part of the reason why London has an elected mayor and city assembly today.

From the late 1970s, other Spanish cities came back to life, spurred on not just by a general sense of liberation, and new-found social, religious, legal and political freedoms, but by a huge, and generally intelligent, investment in public projects, notably in architecture and urban planning. Entire cities may have been transformed, and very much for the better, and yet any number of small towns began to build distinguished modern town halls, schools, libraries, museums, often on a small-scale, but to an exceptional, and critically acclaimed, quality. Here is one country you can visit today where you will find unabashed, yet small-scale, modern buildings complementing and enhancing the look and feel of age-old regional towns.

Spanish architects, meanwhile, began to emerge on the global stage, among them the urbane Rafael Moneo, the spirited Santiago Calatrava and the outlandish Ricardo Bofill. A younger generation soon followed, with Enric Miralles and his Italian-born wife and business partner, Benedetta Tagliabue, invited to design the adventurous, costly and highly controversial Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh, and Alejandro Zaera Polo, whose London-based practice, Foreign Office Architects, founded with his Iranian-born wife, Farshid Moussavi, made their name with the superb port authority terminal at Yokohama, which opened in 2002.

Renaissances in architecture and design, occur when certain cultural and political fuses are lit; for a while these have gone out in Italy, although probably not forever. A week, as Harold Wilson once said, is a long time in politics (a very long time indeed in Italy) and anything can happen. In Spain, that fuse was lit when Franco died, and the cultural fireworks that have lit up Spanish towns and cities have yet to fall to Earth and into the mire of quixotic politics.","Spain has become a byword for home-grown architects who have transformed cities - yet Italy lags far behind.

This may soon be possible with the advent of electrochromic glass. This material is composed of layers of specially formulated metals and plastics, which change their optical properties with electrical stimulation. The windows can also selectively reflect infrared light, which is responsible for much indoor overheating, leading to cooler interiors and lower use of air conditioning.

Tiny cracks in concrete do not necessarily affect structural integrity in the short term, but they do allow water and other chemicals to seep into the structure, which may cause problems over time. Self-healing concrete has embedded clay particles that contain dormant bacteria and a food source. When a crack appears in the concrete, water seeps in and activates the bacteria. When they wake, the bacteria eat their packed lunch and then conveniently excrete chalk, which fills the crack.

Biomimicry – taking inspiration from the natural world to solve our problems – is already in use in buildings such as the Dome at Greenwich, London, where the ""lotus effect"" is used to create self-cleaning surfaces. A drop of water on a lotus leaf stands proud and spherical, as the microscopic surface contours do not allow the drop to spread out. If buildings are designed with surfaces like this, then rainwater just rolls off, taking dirt with it.

This is a solid glass foam saturated with minuscule air bubbles. It is the lightest solid on earth and an extremely efficient insulator. It will one day allow us to build walls or windows that are not only see-through, but will provide efficient insulation – allowing architects of the future more freedom to create visionary structures without worrying about heat loss. Aerogel's eerie appearance has earned it the nickname of ""solid smoke"".

This material is created by joining together two metals that expand at different rates when heated, making the structure bend and contort as the metals grapple with each other at their interface. It may be used in the future to produce specially shaped ""skins"" for buildings that respond to heat in much the same way our own skin does. When it's cold, the skin will remain closed and stop air flowing through it. When it heats up, pores open across its surface, allowing the building to breathe.

The initiative, which began in London in 1992 and celebrates its 22nd edition this week, has since spawned a global network of over 20 cities, from Barcelona to Brisbane, Tel Aviv to Thessaloniki, joined in the last couple years by Gdynia in Poland and the Cypriot capital of Nicosia. The combined programme now includes thousands of buildings and locations, from the lavish halls of embassies and parliaments, to the industrial heft of cement factories and sewage treatment plants, as well as micro-flats and self-build housing schemes, with the number of participating cities expanding year upon year.

“They’re like feral cats, they just keep on arriving,” says Victoria Thornton, who founded the initiative as a “mad idea” to get people more interested in their surroundings, beginning by knocking on doors and pestering building owners herself. The London weekend has since ballooned into a city-wide festival of more than 800 locations, manned by an enthusiastic army of 2,000 volunteers.

This year, the old crowd-drawing favourites of the Foreign Office, Bank of England and Gherkin are joined by the Cheesegrater tower by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners. Each are expected to attract over 5,000 visitors, lured by the thrill of waltzing past security barriers and peering behind locked doors.

For architectural anoraks, the international programme offers new excuses for far-flung pilgrimages, including some rarely opened buildings by Mies van der Rohe and Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago and an Alvar Aalto-themed jog across Helsinki – a 10km route for design disciples that ended up with a rewarding steam in the Finnish maestro’s home sauna.

Vienna staged a particularly diverse line-up, including a trio of gargantuan 1940s grain stores shaped like scaled-up houses and stuffed with a tangled network of pipes and chutes, along with a luxurious apartment designed by Adolf Loos in 1913, now home to a popular pensioners’ bridge club. The socialist slab of the Karl-Marx-Hof tenement complex also opened its doors, alongside more recent Baugruppen co-housing schemes. “In Austria we are very nosey,” says organiser Iris Kaltenegger. “We really like to see how our neighbours live.”

Rome’s weekend, which was held in May, offered a rare glimpse inside the imposing Palazzo della Civiltà Romana, a cubic Colosseum of sparkling white arches in the fascist satellite city of EUR, as well as a group of majestic 1930s gasometers in Testaccio. New York’s annual highlight, meanwhile, is Eero Saarinen’s defunct TWA Terminal at JFK airport, a long abandoned 1960s concrete hymn to the drama of flight, which its owners are threatening to turn into a hotel.

It’s the discussion of such issues that Open House aims to bring to the fore. “It’s not supposed to be aimed at tourists or cultural promotion,” says Thornton. The event must be run by an independent organisation in each city, and not be affiliated to municipal departments or tourist boards. “It’s about getting residents back out on their streets and looking at their own city. It should prompt these conversations and make people start demanding something better.”

It is a politicised call to arms taken up by some of the more divided cities to stage the event, including Jerusalem and Nicosia. Aviva Levinson founded Houses From Within, the Israeli version of Open House, in 2007, with her architect husband, Alon Bin Nun. “We see it as a great model for encouraging a debate about the city in a secular, civilian way of thinking, against the volume of religious extremism here,” she says. The programme ranges from Moshe Safdie-designed housing in the Jewish quarter to Palestinian sites in the east of the capital.

In Nicosia, which held its first Open House weekend in May last year, the event treads carefully between the desires of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. “We try to promote the reunion of the two communities,” says co-ordinator Andreas Kourouklaris, “by opening up the historic buildings that were constructed when Nicosia was one, and the people lived in harmony.” Enrapt in the ethereal light of the 14th-century Hamam Omerye or the Saint John chapel, it might be easy to find a momentary salve for contemporary political turmoil.

Next year will see the event extended to Prague and Cork, Belfast and Monterrey. The organiser of the latter, Daniel Fernández, was inspired by visiting the event in Barcelona while studying there. “I thought it was a great idea, not just for locals to visit their city’s buildings,” he says, “but as a tool to show real estate developers, politicians, business people and citizens what architecture is – and why we should protect those architectural gems that we have.”","From London to Brisbane to Buenos Aires, architecture enthusiasts all over the globe get set to nose around in the world’s greatest buildings for free, writes Oliver Wainwright",31.3548387097,0.6774193548,0.8709677419,medium,low,abstractive,architecture

Known as Salto, the 26cm-tall robot can jump higher than a bullfrog and almost as high as a galago, or bush baby, a small primate found in Africa.

The robot can jump one metre in less than one second, according to the report in the Science Robotics journal.

That's better than a human but not the highest of any robot - other machines have been made that can jump more than three metres in a single leap.

The high-jumping abilities of the galago, or bush baby, inspired the robot. (AAP)

However, Salto does hold the crown in vertical-jumping agility, which researchers define as the ratio of the maximum jump height to the time it takes to complete one jump.

""To have a high vertical-jumping agility, you have to be able to jump high and do it quickly,"" University of California researcher and lead study author Duncan Haldane said yesterday.

Co-author Justin Yin said Salto can ""jump to a height of one metre in 0.58 seconds and be immediately ready to jump again"".

This means Salto can achieve a vertical-jumping agility of 1.75 metres per second, the highest such ratio of any robot to date.

It also attains 78 percent of a galago's vertical-jumping agility, the report said.

Salto, which stands for ""saltatorial locomotion on terrain obstacles,"" weighs just 100g.

The one-legged robot can jump from the floor, flip forward and then kick off a wall, reaching even greater heights.

Researchers hope it will aid rescuers by offering a robot that can easily navigate rubble and tough terrain.

""What originally inspired us to do this work was speaking with first responders down at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Urban Search and Rescue Training site in Menlo Park, California, where they have these giant rubble piles simulating collapsed buildings,"" Mr Haldane said.

""Our goal was to have a search-and-rescue robot small enough to not disturb the rubble further, and to move quickly across the many kinds of rubble produced by collapsed buildings.""

The robot would not be powerful enough to pull a person out of a collapsed building, but might be equipped with sensors that could tip off rescuers to the location of a trapped person.

The single-legged prototype was developed for lab experimentation and is not ready for real-world use.

Battery life is also a problem, with the battery taking up 17 percent of the robot's mass, and allowing it to function for only a couple of minutes at a time.

""Depending on the task that you want to accomplish, you're going to trade off battery life for how high you can jump,"" Mr Haldane said.

The study was funded by the US Army Research Laboratory and the National Science Foundation.","An agile jumping robot inspired by some of the animal world's best leapers could one day help in rescue efforts after earthquakes or building collapses, US scientists have said.",18.46875,1.0,32.0,medium,high,extractive,architecture

The Boston/Dedham Commerce Park has installed 3,300 solar panels on the roof of its building, a mixed use office space that is home to companies such as Dancing Deer Baking Co. and the nonprofit Hyde Park Open Studios.

The $4.2 million project is the largest solar roof installation in the city of Boston.

The solar arrays will generate 974 kilowatts of power, enough to provide about two-thirds of the electricity needs of the building’s tenants.

“This development enables multiple tenants to benefit from clean renewable power,” said Mark Sylvia, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, adding that it will reduce the space’s carbon footprint and energy costs.

The project’s developer, Kathleen Doyle of FireFlower Alternative Energy of Boston, said that by displacing fossil fuels, the rooftop plant will avoid the release of some 366 tons of harmful carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

The project is among a number of solar farms that have come online in recent months and rapidly expanded the amount of electricity the state receives from this renewable source. Earlier in May, the amount of solar power installed in Massachusetts hit 250 megawatts, putting the state well ahead of targets set by Governor Deval Patrick.

“We have seen enormous growth in solar panel installation in Massachusetts in the last two years,” Sylvia said — with more than 100 megawatts of that coming in 2012 alone.

Sylvia attributes the increase to legislative actions, such as the Green Communities Act of 2008, a bill pushed by Patrick to lessen the state’s dependence on fossil fuels and encourage the use of clean technologies and renewable energy.

Last month, Boston Scientific Corp. announced that it installed 3,900 solar panels on the roof of its distribution center in Quincy. It will produce enough electricity to power 145 homes over the course of a year.

http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jan/08/aberdeen-university-library-architecture,http://web.archive.org/web/20150918235132id_/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jan/08/aberdeen-university-library-architecture,Swirl power: Aberdeen's new £57m university library,1970-08-22 05:28:38.235132,"It is an architectural riddle wrapped in a cultural mystery inside a financial enigma. I'm talking about Aberdeen, ever since it became oil rich and the effective capital of Europe's petroleum industry. The puzzle is how this near recession-proof Scottish city has managed to be awash with money (compared with much of Britain), yet hasn't raised a single notable building in the last quarter of a century.

It is a situation made all the more baffling by the fact that the Silver City of yore was, along with Bath and Edinburgh, one of the finest and most readily identifiable architectural compositions on these islands. Its granite monuments – shining silver in sunlight and resembling some artificial mountain range on sunless days – were crafted from a single quarry at Rubislaw. Some 6m tonnes were hewn from the earth until the quarry's closure in 1971, leaving one of the largest man-made holes in Europe.

But the lull is now over – thanks to the completion of the eye-catching new £57m library at the University of Aberdeen. Set on the campus at King's College, the building stands between the city and the sea like a super-modern lighthouse, beaming out a message – loud, clear and dazzling – that Aberdeen is back on the architectural map.

Rising like a perfectly geometric glass monolith from a clutter of university structures, but with the beautiful late-medieval King's College buildings close by, this seven-storey tower comes as something of a shock: despite its solid square shape, the library has an ethereal air, especially when lit up at night, thanks to its gleaming striated facades, boasting 720 panels in all. This gives a striking contrast to its rugged setting.

Designed by Danish architects Schmidt Hammer Lassen, the library has plenty more surprises. If those exteriors aren't enough to stop you in your tracks, then what about the spiralling off-centre atrium at the core of the building, soaring up from the double-height entrance lobby to a distant glass roof? This offers the kind of giddying spatial shock normally associated with 17th-century baroque churches. The atrium, an architectural whirlwind, seems to twist around as it climbs up and through the structure, pushing its way further on to each successive floor. Stand at the foot of this highly theatrical space and, as the winter sun moves around the library, you feel as if you're inside a hollowed-out iceberg. It also makes you feel part of an intriguing architectural conundrum: the library is both icily calm yet restlessly alive, as modern as it is baroque.

Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising. Founded in the Danish port of Aarhus in 1986, SHL has a reputation for making distinctive cultural buildings that marry elements from nature and science. The firm came to global attention in 1997 with the Katuaq Cultural Centre in Nuuk, Greenland. Its undulating walls, clad in larch, were inspired by the rippling bands of the northern lights, a feature of the night skies over the Arctic – and not unknown to Aberdeen.

But SHL's most famous building is the Black Diamond, as the momentous Danish Royal Library extension on the Copenhagen waterfront is known. Opened in 1999, it takes the form of a giant angular prism clad in dark granite and split in two by a clear glass atrium, clearly the firm's strong point. SHL are currently working on what will be Scandinavia's largest library, the €228m (£190m) Urban Mediaspace in Aarhus, a huge building – again all prisms and atriums – that the architects describe as a covered public space.

You could say the same of the Aberdeen library. The public is welcomed into the foyer. Here, alongside the eye-boggling view upwards, there is a coffee bar named the Hardback Cafe, not to mention spaces for presentations and a big cube of a gallery. I enjoyed its first show, Rebels with a Cause: Jacobites and the Global Imagination, drawn from the superb archive housed in the lower ground floor. Here, in and around the elegant Wolfson reading room, there are some 200,000 rare books, as well as material dating back to the third century BC.

The students' library proper is housed on the floors above the foyer. White-walled, grey-carpeted and boasting fine views out to the university, the city and the sea, these are reached by sleek glass lifts or warehouse-like stairs. The core of each floor is given over to smart white stacks of books: there are 13km of shelves above ground holding 400,000 books, their colours offsetting that quietly dominant white-and-grey colour scheme. It was quiet when I visited recently, the vast majority of students being away for the holidays, so I couldn't be sure about the noise in term time. But surely all the cafe chatter and clatter, the steamy hisses and gurgles of coffee-making, will percolate up the atrium?

""What I've noticed,"" says Stuart Hill, a lead designer on the project, ""is that the students tend to gravitate towards the more vibrant spaces around the atrium closer to the ground floor. Most seem to work with headphones on anyway, blissfully unaware of any unwanted noise. The collaborative study areas are being used extensively, while the silent study spaces aren't used as much as we thought they would."" The nature of libraries, adds Hill, is changing in the digital era. ""One of the questions we were asked before we finalised the design is: why build a new library at all in this day and age? The answer is: we've been helping to build a new type of library. ""

Indeed, the wide-open floors are clearly intended as a social space as well as a place of learning, with Wi-Fi available throughout the building as it is around much of the campus. Unlike the traditional silence associated with libraries, it seems there will always be a background hum; perhaps many students today are happy with this. Personally, I would find the top floor a rather distracting place to work: looking out through its windows, I felt that the entire Granite City had been laid out for my inspection. It was all too easy to let time slide by, watching the big blue and white ferries setting off for Orkney and Shetland, as seabirds wheeled across a boundless sky.

While a thrilling design, the library may yet need a little work to make it shine in the manner it deserves to. Some of the finishes seem a little rough and ready, while the unisex lavatories are a curiosity that may prove a step too far. Hill points out that the building won't be complete until September, when it will be officially opened. ""There are areas we're not totally happy with, but we'll sort these out.""

The library faces and dominates a new public plaza, also by SHL. As I step out on to it, the glass and steel tower behind me lights up for the night, not quite shimmering like the northern lights, but drawing attention to itself in a way that makes it quite clear that this modern addition is the new focal point of a university aiming high.

Curiously, the library rises from a plinth made of Caithness stone. Why not granite? ""Unbelievably,"" says Hill, ""granite as a facing stone for buildings isn't available today, except from China. But one geology student noticed that the pattern on the facade is very similar to granite when viewed under a microscope – a rather poetic connection, we think, to the traditional architecture of Aberdeen.""",Aberdeen university's extraordinary new library has put the Silver City back on the architectural map.

The article below should have acknowledged reference to a piece by Marcus Fairs that appeared in Icon magazine. Apologies.

Zaha Hadid offers a moist, limp hand to shake. She's coming down with flu. This is a disappointment. Where is the vibrant monster I'd been promised from previous interviews? Where's the ball-breaking harridan barking abuse in Arabic into her mobile as she wafts into her north-London studio in vertiginous heels, before snarling unpleasant things to her staff in terrifyingly idiomatic Anglo-Saxon?

""It's all the flying I do,"" says Hadid, glancing at me with sad brown eyes. ""I don't know what they put in the air on those planes, but it is really affecting my health."" Since she won the Pritzker prize last month - effectively the Nobel Prize for architecture - Hadid, 53, hasn't stopped travelling. She's just back from Vienna, where she teaches, and will be jetting off again soon to oversee her many projects. To Rome, perhaps, where her extraordinary National Centre of Contemporary Arts (less a spaghetti junction than a tangle of chopped-up tagliatelli freeways) is under construction. Or to Leipzig, where her offices and technical spaces for BMW's HQ will mingle white and blue collars in a hearteningly egalitarian manner. Or to Wolfburg, also in Germany, where she's building a science centre. Or to Italy, where her Salerno ferry terminal is being thrown up. It's conceived like an oyster: hard on the outside, soft and fluid on the inside, and rather gorgeous all over. ""The aquatic topography will offer insistently differentiated spaces, and experience, whilst providing clear orientation,"" explains Hadid's website. Love that ""insistently"".

These days Hadid needs more in her luggage than her trademark black Issey Mayake suits. She needs a hard hat - because people around the world are finally building her designs. Before the end of the year, she says, it is very likely that 10,000 workers will descend on a 35.2 hectare site in Beijing to work on something called Soho City. This development will, incidentally, give the lie to the notion that this woman doesn't do macho phalluses in glass and steel: before the decade is out there will be a forest of them in the south-east corner of Beijing's Fourth Ring.

For years, though, Zaha Hadid was known as the paper architect. Her genius lived in paintings and digital mock-ups, but died when exposed to the grizzly business of competitions and planning bids. She won awards, sometimes as many as four a year, but made a negligible contribution to the world's built environment. For many years her only substantial realised project was a fire station at a furniture works near Basel, but even that mutated into a millstone around her reputation. It was soon turned into a visitors' centre - and rumours spread claiming that her beautiful buildings might be rubbish at doing the jobs for which they were intended.

Then there was the C-word, one that only the boldest use in Hadid's presence. Cardiff - the city that nixed her opera house project in 1994 in favour of a rugby stadium, leaving Britain's global reputation for architectural conservatism intact. She seethed against the rejection of her scheme by politicians, some of whom had worried - she claims - about giving the project to a ""foreigner"". For the record, Hadid is a British citizen, an Arab, a Sunni Muslim, an Iraqi brought up in pre-Saddam Baghdad and educated by Catholic nuns and, since 2002, a Commander of the British Empire. ""Maybe they're scared of me. I'm very outspoken,"" says Hadid. ""I'm speculating here. I don't really know.""

Since the late-1990s she says, things have improved - at least in terms of winning overseas commissions. ""The prejudice is lifting,"" she says. But which one? Prejudice against women? Prejudice against someone who is outspoken? Or prejudice against Arabs? ""Mostly the last one. Maybe now it's OK to be an Iraqi. It certainly wasn't.""

The prejudices have lifted so much that Hadid won the Pritzker prize. She was the first woman to do so. ""I never use the issue about being a woman architect, but if it helps younger people to know they can break through the glass ceiling I don't mind that. One thing that's exciting for me is that there's no stereotype of what I should do. It's very liberating.""

Hadid was born in Baghdad in 1950. Her father was a Baghdad industrialist and a leading politician in the doomed Iraqi democracy that followed the end of the British mandate in 1958. She hasn't been back for 30 years, resolutely declines to comment on the current occupation (perhaps unsurprisingly, given that many of her most lucrative commissions are American), but recalls the Iraqi capital as a progressive place - especially for women. ""When the men went to war, which Iraq did repeatedly against Iran, women ran the place. Most of my girlfriends wanted to be professionals. I wanted to be an architect. It didn't seem strange.""

Nor did it seem strange for her to come to London to study at the Architectural Association in the early 1970s. It was a heady time: teachers, including Rem Koolhaas, Nigel Coates, Bernard Tschumi and Daniel Libeskind, challenged students to cast off their enthusiasms for modernist and postmodernist architects and develop a more radically experimental architecture. For Hadid, steeped as she was in the works of Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Russian constructivists (she's still looking forward to the Pritzker award ceremony in St Petersburg next month, chiefly because it is the home-town of her beloved Malevich), this was chastening stuff.

""The normative orthodoxy was overwhelming - you could only do buildings in one particular way. But my iconoclastic teachers helped us rebel against all that."" And how. Hadid has, since graduation in 1977, developed radical new ways of arranging space and structure. Her buildings are not accumulations of stacked planes, but rather non-repeating layers that respond to patterns of use. For example, those twists of pasta at the Rome museum are flexible exhibition spaces that can be locked into each other depending on what is going on display.

Her designs are distinguished by sharp angles, flowing lines and dramatic juxtapositions. Critics suggested that there was something almost geological in her jagged and extruded forms, as if her buildings had been created not by woman but by the force of nature. But Hadid regards her works as responding to the site's landscape.

She likes talking about porosity, about estuarial flows. In Leipzig, for instance: ""The idea was to create areas where everything is accessible and everybody can flow everywhere - to move away from the normative notion of the perimeter block as a fortified space."" A political architecture then? ""It is political because it is about openness. I baulk at using the term democratic.""

She shows me photographs of her largest built project so far, the Rosenthal Centre for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati, which opened last year. ""Look at this urban carpet,"" she says, pointing at the concrete path that is the floor of the transparent foyer. It then curves upwards to form the back of a central well in which a huge steel staircase (made by a local manufacturer of roller coasters) rises to provide access to six floors of gallery and office space. ""The idea is to be open, to whisk people into the building and make them feel it is theirs.""

Other more minor but no less beautiful constructions have been built - a ski jump near Innsbruck, a fire station in Vitra, a railway station in Strasbourg. It's a fat file of architectural achievement, though with one big exception. There's nothing in London. Indeed, the only British project Zaha Hadid Architects have on the go at the moment is a cancer care drop-in centre called Maggie's Centre in Kirkcaldy, Fife.

""They should really take advantage of us because we are here, and we are very imaginative. We have to be because the projects we work on have little money and little space."" But nothing is happening: her Holloway Road bridge was never built, her redevelopment of Bishopsgate was stymied, and don't even ask why she didn't win the competition for the new BBC Music Centre at White City. ""I guess you go into competitions and somebody wins. We were very disappointed. It was a tremendous scheme.""

For the time being, Hadid can console herself with some more looming projects - a new Guggenheim for Taichung in Taiwan, a science hub in Singapore, a museum extension in Copenhagen, even another opera house (this one in Guangzhou, China).

""Zaha Hadid is an architect who consistently pushes the boundaries of architecture and urban design,"" says her website. Love that ""consistently"", I say, but it does sound tiring. ""It is,"" she tells me. ""We're working all hours."" Workaholic and single, Hadid seems destined to have only one longtime companion - galloping influenza, the kind brought on by jetting to foreign climes to see dreams become real.",Zaha Hadid was once famous for not getting anything built.

His secret? Tweets, status updates, and web chatter.

Before the rise of online radio station Pandora and music video sites such as Vevo — and years before Apple AAPL launched its iTunes music store — Eric Garland reckoned that the Internet was going to transform the music industry. Back in 2000, when a lot of online listening activity involved illegal peer-to-peer file

sharing via services such as Napster, Garland believed that all the online activity could actually help lesser-known bands and artists market themselves, if they could just quantify their successes. So he and

Tom Allison, a former Coca-Cola coke marketing executive, formed BigChampagne to catalogue file sharing and MP3 downloads.

Since then, digital downloading has gone legit: The iTunes Store, which opened in 2003, has sold more than 10 billion songs. Pandora has turned a profit. Even Napster has been rebranded as a legal subscription service. And BigChampagne, based in Beverly Hills, is more relevant than ever. Today it tracks sales, downloads, and listening activity on just about every music-distribution platform, from iTunes to FM radio to MySpace. (And, yes, it still tracks illegal file sharing too.)

BigChampagne then analyzes and sells the data to record labels, talent agents, and radio stations that are looking to find under-the-radar acts. Increasingly, clients also want to gauge the impact of social media such as Twitter, which recording artists have embraced wholeheartedly. (Just check out Kanye West’s Twitter feed.) In late July, BigChampagne unveiled its latest creation, the Ultimate Chart, which supplements widely available data on sales on Amazon AMZN and iTunes with metrics that measure a song’s buzz: YouTube goog and MySpace hits, Twitter and Facebook mentions, Clear Channel radio spins, and Rhapsody and Last.fm streams. “We are certainly trying to narrow the really significant gap between the charts that are published on a week-to-week basis and the actual artist-to-fan connection,” Garland says.

Industry reaction to the new list has been mixed. Reps for Billboard and Nielsen Soundscan wouldn’t comment, but one music industry executive says of the Ultimate Chart: “It’s like the People’s Choice Awards. It’s hype for the sake of hype.”

Ultimate Chart rankings don’t always differ wildly from sales data. Bruno Mars’ “Just the Way You Are” was No. 1 on BigChampagne’s list during the week of Oct. 4, as it was on the Billboard Hot 100. But the “Glee” soundtrack version of the Alicia Keys/Jay-Z New York City anthem “Empire State of Mind” hit No. 7 on BigChampagne, vs. No. 21 on Billboard. That reflects under-measured online buzz following both the “Glee goes to New York” TV episode and a viral “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon” video in which Fallon and Justin Timberlake rap the history of hip-hop in less than four minutes. “The real measure of passion is sales,” says Avery Lipman, co-president of Universal Republic Records, a unit of Vivendi’s Universal Music Group. “That said, how can you ignore and discount 50 million [online] plays of Lady Gaga?”

BigChampagne uses a mix of software and human referees to compile its data. Its technology monitors web searches and catalogues music in consumers’ shared folders. Meanwhile, a dozen or so “matchers” sit at a bank of computers and make real-time decisions about the data. Does a track that “features” Jay-Z count as a Jay-Z track, or should it be attributed to another artist? “We have taught computers over many years to be very consistent about reconciling all this different data,” Garland says. “But we’ve also put editors in place to settle disputes.”

Garland, 38, started his career as a management consultant, but he also happened to be a file sharer and music fan. (“I’ve always liked pop music for old people,” he says.) He won’t disclose sales — BigChampagne is privately held but in a dozen years it has expanded from its Napster-era roots and now measures data from iTunes, Amazon, eMusic, AT&T t , YouTube, MySpace, Last.fm, Facebook, and Twitter. Garland says he plans to expand the Ultimate Chart to track the popularity of albums. He also envisions expanding to other media, such as videogames, TV, even movies. Any product that can be consumed online then tweeted or recommended or friended is a candidate for BigChampagne to measure. Critics may dismiss the company’s Ultimate lists as hype, but someday they may be as mainstream as, well, digital music.","Entrepreneur Eric Garland thinks he has a better music chart. His secret?

A Long Island couple says an architect ripped off the blueprint to their one-of-a-kind dream house — to build a carbon copy in the town next door.

Rivka Fortgang, an interior and exterior home designer from Five Towns, and her husband, Seth are now suing to block the mansion on Villa Place in Cedarhurst from being built because it will look nearly identical to their own home on Auerbach Lane in Lawrence, just a mile away.

The Fortgangs “constructed their unique home from the ground up, creating a visually distinctive and unique exterior stucco façade” in 2005 and copyrighted the original architectural drawings under the name “Fortgang Residence I,” according to the suit, filed Thursday in Long Island federal court.

The couple claims the firm Pereiras Architects Ubiquitous and property owners Daniella and Ari Schwartz accessed their exclusive plans in property records last August through the Lawrence buildings department — without their permission.

“There is no doubt that you have accessed and intentionally copied the plans of the Fortgang residence intending to create a replica of our clients’ home and distinctive exterior,” the Fortgang’s lawyer Steven Stern wrote in a cease-and-desist letter dated June 7.

The Villa home is in the early stages of construction but renderings show that it will be “substantially similar” to the Fortgang’s McMansion, the complaint says.

Their home features several giant, black-rimmed windows on the front and peaked windows on the roof.

The Villa residence design also has similarly styled-windows.

A lawyer for Daniella Schwartz argued that the two designs are, in fact, different.

“We note that the exterior façade of the Fortgang resident consists of several windows, rather generic gables, and entry way doors,” attorney Daniel Schloss wrote in a court filing.

Schloss also noted that the Villa property is “literally in another town and separated from the Fortgang residence by several major thoroughfares and commercial districts.”

The accused copycats agreed to temporarily halt construction “pending certain changes and amendments to its exterior façade elements,” court papers show.

But new color renderings of the Villa home were hardly changed, spurring the copyright infringement lawsuit.

The Fortgangs are suing for unspecified damages.

Rivka also claims her business and reputation as a designer in the Five Towns community has suffered due to the housing hoopla.

The Fortgang’s fortress boasts more than 4,400 square feet of space and 5 ¹/₂ bathrooms, according to Zillow.com, which estimates it’s worth $1.4 million.

A representative from Pereiras Architects Ubiquitous declined to comment.

London is expected to be invaded by some 60m sq ft of new offices in the next few years. That's roughly 60 more tall buildings. How many of them will be works of civic art? How many designed for an increasingly Bladerunner-like urban sense and scale? Well, if P&O Developments has its way, at least one.

The company is better known for shipping than property, but it has planning permission to build a range of new offices at Waterloo. Architects RHWL were commissioned to design a trio of conventional postmodern office pavilions for a site ranging along York Road. But William Edgerley, P&O's managing director, wanted to do something better with the site, the building, the company's money and for London. By chance, he met Christopher Le Brun at a school sports day recently. And now Le Brun - a well-known painter, sculptor and former trustee of the Tate and the National Gallery - is part of the architectural crew.

Le Brun had never thought of working on a building. He was also unsure of quite what skills he could bring to the demanding design of a major commercial building, when it was already in the hands of competent architects and Chris Wise, the lively engineer best known for his work with Norman Foster and Anthony Caro on the Millennium Bridge. And yet what Le Brun has helped create is a complete reconsideration of the tall commercial building.

Together, architects, engineer and artist have come up with a highly sculpted tower that looks like some giant, twisted aerofoil. Rising from a prowed plinth between Howard Robertson's monumental, Speer-like Shell Centre, the London and South Western Railway's Victory Arch and Nicholas Grimshaw's serpentine Waterloo International Terminal, the proposed building is more than an ambitious office block. Its plinth is designed to be a public space - a tree-lined pedestrian concourse, bridge and walk connecting Waterloo and the South Bank in one seamless flow. Its construction would entail the rerouting of York Road, and the demolition of a number of grim buildings that have disgraced Waterloo for many years, in particular the Tower Building, John Poulson's early 1960s tower, now home to the government's Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe).

Le Brun has undoubtedly brought artistry to RHWL and P&O's ambition. The wax models and sketches he has made to date are substantial proof of this. He talks convincingly about the ways in which light will fall against, and play with, the complex twisted vertical surfaces of the tower. He delights in thinking through ways in which the tower's plinth could be a beautifully lit artwork in its own right, perhaps pulsating with information and advertising relating to public transport and South Bank events. He suggests ways in which the tall office ""wing"" could be lit at night by slabs of colour.

Suspicious of hard, shiny computer drawings that ""portray buildings intended for London in Venetian or Californian light"", Le Brun has produced a set of subtle drawings, realised in shades of soft, London greys. He likes to draw in his Camberwell studio into the gloaming. ""Mostly,"" he says, ""we see London buildings in soft, hazy and cloudy light; I think it is important to try to get a feel of what a large building like this would really look like.""

His wax models are even more beautiful - and more convincing. It would be fascinating to see one turned into a real building. To house such a big building in a relatively tight space over a web of railway lines, and to avoid conflict with ""air rights"" and issues of daylight with existing buildings, will require delicate balancing and inventive engineering. An office must also have its floors, its windows and expansive glass facades, and these need to be worked convincingly into the twisted wing profile of the P&O tower. Architects, engineer and artist have collaborated on a computer model that shows how this can be done, no matter which way the model is twisted and turned.

If a world-class architect such as Frank Gehry or Zaha Hadid were to propose a building along such provocative lines, they would be praised to the skies. RWHL, however, are commercial architects. Until now the practice has been a purveyor of conventional, sometimes bland design. With Wise and Le Brun, it has moved into new territory: a flagship commercial building that takes artistic risks, demands imaginative engineering and invites intense, sharpshooting criticism.

Whoever the architect, all must agree that in years to come, office design must be a lot better than it has been to date. The P&O project creates a model for the onslaught of commercial buildings to follow: it is near a railway station (reducing the need for car parks), it gives something back to the city, and is a work of art in itself.

Le Brun, and Wise, in their different, yet mutually compatible ways, have raised the design game at Waterloo. And Le Brun is properly concerned that, should the building go ahead, he will continue to have some say on both its design and construction. It would be sad if the artist were simply being employed as a cultured pet to help smooth the project through planning permission; thankfully, this is not the case. What matters, however, is that a building of this ambition and prominence is beautifully built throughout. The nature of development has much to do with speed and timing, and a scheme like this needs time to get right. Time for subtlety; time for something of an artist's touch.",Jonathan Glancey on how a sculpture by Christopher Le Brun became the template for the office of the future.,54.75,0.7000000000000001,1.2,high,low,abstractive,architecture

For the Spanish conquistadors, uniting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at the American continent’s narrowest point would enable the easy passage of silver and gold from Incan territory. Similarly, during the 19th-century gold rush, Americans saw the opportunity of swift transfer between West Coast and East, at a time when much of America was still wilderness.

A canal would cut days – and 8,000 miles – off voyages around the southern tip of the Americas, at Cape Horn. In short, the notion of cutting the continent in half attracted capitalists from generation after generation. From Britain alone, Sir Francis Drake and Henry Morgan both tried to seize Panama from Spanish hands.

Most infamously, in 1698, Scottish entrepreneur William Paterson convinced his government to invest half the national savings into setting up an isthmian colony at Darien. A coast-to-coast canal would, he said, yield “the gates to the Pacific and keys to the universe”. Yet, within months, his 1,200-strong expedition had been defeated by the twin enemy of tropical disease and Spanish defence forces – one crucial consequence being the decision of impoverished Scots to sign the Act of Union with England.

Original dreamer: Vasco Núñez de Balboa discovers the Pacific in 1513

It wasn’t until the 19th century, though, that technology finally caught up with aspiration. This was the peak of the “canal age”, as man-made waterways – such as the Erie, joining New York to the Great Lakes – slashed journey times and transport costs in Europe and North America.

Perhaps the key canal of all, however, was the Suez, in Egypt, which from 1869 allowed ships to travel between Europe and east Asia without navigating around South Africa. Its pioneer was Frenchman Ferdinand de Lesseps, who, riding a wave of confidence in Victorian technological progress, soon set his sights on Panama. His aim? To build “a bridge across the Americas”.

Parisians queued around the block of their stock exchange, the Bourse, to invest in the scheme. But, despite the task – creating a waterway just 48 miles in length – looking relatively simple, it was anything but. De Lesseps had insisted on a sea-level canal, just like at Suez, rather than a lock-operated one – failing to appreciate the unique geography of Panama, not least the mighty Cordillera, the range of mountains that runs down the country’s spine.

In part, this was a hubristic belief in man’s power to tame nature; in part, it was a commercial decision, believing that a sea-level transit would be both swifter and more profitable. However, at the notorious Culebra pass, through the Cordillera, depths of around 300 ft had to be dug – for nine miles – and de Lesseps’s men and machines just weren’t up to it, especially in rainy season when mudslides and flooding kept returning all the earth they’d just removed.

The heat blazed too, and the soil – with its 17 different rock formations – was like nothing geologists had ever seen. There seemed no solution either to yellow fever and malaria, diseases which were killing off workers at a terrifying rate. During the eight years of French excavation from 1881, more than 20,000 workers died, most of them drafted in for a pittance from the West Indies.

Workers, such as the ones pictured above in 1909, laboured on the Panama Canal project for nine years

Against such odds, the project was doomed to failure, though de Lesseps periodically served up false, optimistic reports to keep investor confidence high. The crash of his Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interocéanique was the biggest of the 19th century. The savings of 800,000 private investors (totalling 1 billion francs) were completely wiped out.

It’s testament to the sheer power of the canal as a concept that anyone would want to tackle the Herculean task again so quickly. Yet that is exactly what America would do, flexing its muscles beyond its borders for the first time. Having gained independence from Spain in 1821, Panama was now part of Colombia. Yet, rather than cooperate with Bogota, President Theodore Roosevelt opted to incite a nationalist insurrection, and gave crucial support to Panamanian rebels fighting for independence. The Republic of Panama was born in 1903, though a slender “Canal Zone” was handed over to America in perpetuity.

For Roosevelt, control over both the Atlantic and Pacific grew increasingly important – for which an isthmian canal would be crucial – and he asked William Taft (his eventual successor as president) to oversee the project. Learning from the French debacle, Taft backed a lock-canal system, and thanks to the healthy wages on offer, there was no shortage of construction workers, many from Europe. One of them was Pedro Hernandez, an olive-picker from northern Spain. “Opportunities at home were scarce,” says his great-grandson Jaime Massot, 55, a hydrologist at the canal today. “The Panama Canal represented a bold, new start for him.”

Yet, Roosevelt’s chief medical officer, Dr William Gorgas, knew that success could only be achieved if yellow fever was eliminated first. “Trouble was, no one knew what caused it,” recalls Massot. “Some attributed it to dirty water, others to poisonous airs,” some even to the debauched, late-night pursuits in Panama City.

Working at Culebra, 10 hours a day, six days a week, Hernandez caught yellow fever and “became so lifeless, the hospital doctors thought he’d died”, says Massot. “They placed him in a coffin. Thank goodness, though, one of the nurses heard a knocking sound on the wood – somehow my grandfather had found the energy to let them know he was alive, and they let him out.” Hernandez made a full recovery and ended up settling in Panama for the rest of his long life. The less fortunate had their cadavers sold to medical schools in America for dissection classes.

Gorgas was adamant that mosquitoes were the disease carriers. Given a blank cheque by Roosevelt, his tactic of fumigating cities and persuading Panamanians to stop storing water in open containers proved a masterstroke. Within six months, yellow fever had been eradicated and malaria sent into steep decline, meaning the engineers could now, at last, concentrate on the task at hand.

For starters, Roosevelt’s chief engineer, John Stevens (the man behind America’s Great Northern Railway), installed an efficient railroad. By coordinating steam-shovel and train movements, he kept the soil moving out and away with the efficiency of a conveyor belt.

The blasting and excavation of the Culebra Cut – aka Hell’s Gorge – would still prove a construction headache, involving, as it did, the transformation of a mountain into a valley. Mercifully, the lock-based system – in which the canal rises 280ft on the way up from one coast, crosses the Cordillera, then drops back down 280ft towards the other – meant much less digging than a sea-level system. The Americans also had the advantage of bulldozers, steam-powered cranes and hydraulic rock-crushers to make their job easier – all newly pioneered in America in the Second Industrial Revolution. Back home, the press gleefully reported on every breakthrough.

The engineering genius of the canal lies in its sheer simplicity – with no pumps, just a reliance on gravity and climate. At 110 ft wide and 41 deep, the canal’s three sets of locks were the largest in the world, their filling achieved through the abundant Panamanian rainfall and culverts which channel water from damned lakes. The largest lake of all, Gatun, was created by damming the temperamental River Chagres, using the soil and rock excavated from Culebra. In rainy season, a flooding Chagres was lethal – and so the engineers made the cute decision to exploit the river rather than battle it.

After nine years’ labour the canal finally opened, and man’s greatest victory over nature until the moon landings was complete. World trade was opened up and transformed forever. It also confirmed the rise of America as the world’s pre-eminent power in the very month that Europe descended into carnage. With the Panama Canal, the American century had truly begun.

The successful transit of the first ship in 1914

The opening-day celebrations were largely subdued, as it was less than a fortnight after the declaration of the First World War. No international dignitaries came and news was barely reported: “The Panama Canal is open to the commerce of the world,” announced The New York Times, almost apologetically, on page 14.

The first trading ship to travel from San Francisco to New York via the canal, the Pleiades, arrived on August 24 1914. The isthmus would remain of major economic and geopolitical importance to America for the next 85 years – not to mention an imperial symbol through which American power and prosperity flowed. It linked their navy’s Atlantic and Pacific fleets, ferrying men and resources during the Second World, Korean and Vietnam wars. However, with the tailing off of the Cold War, America agreed to hand over control of the canal to Panama, on December 31 1999.

The transition was seamless. The autonomous government agency, the Panama Canal Authority (PCA), has proved a steady hand on the tiller. The canal largely functions as it did a century ago, a typical crossing taking between eight and 10 hours, and remains a vital avenue of world trade, connecting 1,700 ports in 160 countries. An average of 40 ships cross daily, each one earning Panama approximately £30,000 (which, altogether, makes Panama £800m a year).

In many ways, the canal has been a victim of its own success. In a bid to cash in, China is now investing $50 billion to construct a waterway across Nicaragua. And there are talks of other projects across Honduras and Guatemala.

What’s more, time waits for no man. At the turn of the 20th century, the canal could easily accommodate any vessel yet built (the mighty Titanic, at 90ft wide, could fit with plenty of room to spare). Now, however, companies are building ships a quarter-of-a-mile long, wider than a motorway and capable of carrying up to 18,000 containers. Known as “Post-Panamax”, they are too big for the canal as it stands, so the PCA is expanding the waterway to double its capacity.

“It was no good resting on our laurels,” says Diego Miguez, the PCA’s vice president of finance. “The canal was a masterpiece of engineering, but it gives us no divine right to future trade. We’re an entirely commercial operation, and must keep up with the developments in 21st-century shipping and commerce.”

Expansion work, to the tune of £3 billion, was approved in a national referendum in 2007, to accommodate the new Post-Panamax ship. However, just like a century or so previously, progress hasn’t been straightforward. First, the workers downed tools to strike for better wages; then the Spanish firm contracted to provide the new locks, Sacyr, refused to foot the bill for £1 billion cost overruns. Jorge Quijano, the PCA’s CEO, responded by accusing Sacyr of racism, disrespect and treating Panamanians “like a bunch of American Indians still wearing feathers on our heads”. All disputes seem to have been resolved now, and the work is 80 per cent complete, but the opening date has been put back to January 2016.

Today, the canal is being expanded to accommodate larger ships

Other challenges remain too. How long, for instance, can Panama afford to keep widening its canal as ships get bigger and bigger? Certain vessels are already too big even for the new locks. What’s more, climate change experts question whether the rainfall in Panama will persist at levels to keep the canal operational and also whether the melting of polar ice caps might enable a new, rival navigational route through the Arctic to open up.

Miguez, however, is optimistic. “We have a long-successful operation and a strong, satisfied customer base,” he says. “Our aim is to continue to be major players in maritime trade worldwide.” Certainly, many of the canal’s trade routes are still booming: raw materials like coal and iron ore from Latin America – and liquefied natural gas from America – head to China and its fast-industrialising neighbours, just as manufactured goods are heading back in the other direction.

It remains one of history’s tragic coincidences that the Panama Canal should open just as Europeans were deploying new technologies for mass slaughter, thus shattering faith in progress and mechanisation. For, if the First World War marked the end of an era, the Panama Canal represented its final, brilliant hurrah – an age of manned flight, submarines and the Kinetoscope, of confidence and can-do, when nothing seemed impossible. Not even a bridge across the world.

(Twitter/@SteenAJ)

Copenhagen police believe they have shot dead the gunman responsible for two fatal attacks in the Danish capital.

The city is still in lockdown following the string of shootings, including an incident that saw a gunman pump hundreds of rounds into a cafe where a debate on Islam and freedom of speech was underway.

In a separate shooting one person was shot in the head outside a synagogue while two police officers were shot in the arm and leg.

Copenhagen Police have confirmed they have now shot and killed the man believed responsible.

Police said video surveillance indicated the man was behind both killings.

The offender was shot dead in the suburb of Norrebro near a train station.

""The man was hailed, he opened fire on the police and were then shot. The man has died . No police officers were hit,"" a police statement said.

People in Copenhagen are being urged to follow all directions from police and to be alert and aware.

Police earlier labelled the first attack on a cafe as a ""terrorist attack"".

A gunman killed a middle-aged Danish man after opening fire in a cafe where a debate on Islam, art and freedom of speech was taking place.

The gunman wore black and and was speaking in Danish when he reportedly fired at least 100 bullets through the window.

Chilling audio of the moment the gunman began shooting has been released. We warn some viewers may find it distressing.

Headlining the event was Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, known for his 2007 caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.

Vilks has been living under police protection after his controversial cartoons prompted death threats.

The shooter has been described as 25-30 years old, around 185cm (six feet) tall, with an athletic build.

Police initially said two suspects had fled the scene in a Volkswagen Polo. The car was found abandoned around two hours after the attack.

After witness statements indicated there was just one attacker, police later said they were hunting for a lone gunman.

The terror attack has been condemned by Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt.

""Denmark has today been hit by a cynical act of violence. Everything leads us to believe that the shooting was a political attack and therefore a terrorist act,"" Ms Thorning-Schmidt said.

Three police officers were wounded attempting to protect those inside the venue, according to police.

A spokesman for Copenhagen Police urged people in the city to exercise caution.

""We have a massive presence in the city, and we urge that you take care when walking in the city,"" Allan Wadsworth-Hansen said.

The assault comes at a time of heightened security and rising fears of Islamist attacks, following January 7-9 incidents in Paris that left 17 people dead.

Anti-terror sweeps carried out across Europe since mid-January have resulted in the arrests of dozens of suspected jihadists and seizures of large stocks of weapons and explosives.

French ambassador Francois Zimeray, who was at the debate, said the attack had ""the same intention as Charlie Hebdo"", referring to the killings at the satirical newspaper in Paris last month.

""Intuitively I would say there were at least 50 gunshots, and the police here are saying 200,"" he said.

""Bullets went through the doors and everyone threw themselves to the floor. We managed to flee the room, and now we're staying inside because it's still dangerous. The attackers haven't been caught and they could very well still be in the neighbourhood.""

Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Christophe Deloire said concern of renewed attacks targeting symbols of freedom of speech and the press have been growing since the Charlie Hebdo assault.

""It's something that we feared after Charlie Hebdo. We see that ultra-radical groups are leading a war against freedom of expression, against the freedom to be irreverent about religion and against the simple freedom to debate them,"" Deloire said.

Speaking at the time of the shooting was Femen feminist activist Inna Shevchenko.

""I was at the point of my speech when I was saying that often it is an illusion that we have freedom of speech in Europe. Then we heard shots,"" she told the Telegraph.

These are not possible with membership of the single market. Three into two doesn’t go.

Thus, as was the case during the referendum, the debate looks set to focus on the pros and cons of single market membership, and on what this implies for any future renegotiation.

There is no doubt, as we saw in the campaign, that some firms, given their business model, see it as in their own interests to remain in.

But the key debate is whether single market membership is a key national interest. And I am not convinced that it is. And neither it seems are the public, particularly, given the trade-offs that it implies.

But even in economic terms there is a strong case to leave the single market. We do not need to be in the single market to have access to it, while being outside not only returns control over laws and borders but frees the UK from EU regulations, its external tariff and allows us, as a service sector economy, to position ourselves globally, compete internationally, particularly in financial services, and play to our strengths.

We need to communicate this positive global message at next month’s G20 meeting in China.

We should also be more confident about our ability to adapt and change.

Last week, the European Central Bank released its latest Economic Bulletin and it contained one telling chart that is shown here. The vertical axis shows flexibility of labour and product markets. The horizontal axis shows countries with flexible institutions.

The top right hand corner is the best place, with the economies most flexible to cope with economic change. The UK fares well.

The UK has a great opportunity to position for future success with a mutually reinforcing social and economic agenda.

You can just hear Gerry Marsden singing Ferry Cross the Mersey back when Liverpool was one of the world's best loved cities. Imagine if Ferry Cross the Mersey was remade in 2015 and, instead of the Liver Building, Pier Head and working docks, the backdrop was an almighty prickle of skyscrapers and other schlock shipped in from anywhere except Merseyside itself.

More than hearts may be torn if the city gives the go-ahead to the titanic and controversial £5.5bn Liverpool Waters project proposed by property developers Peel Holdings. Unesco is so angry with what its inspectors have seen of the designs that it has threatened – and not for the first time – to strip Liverpool's city centre of its World Heritage Site status. While in other parts of the world this would matter, Liverpool – to judge from comments made in the local media – doesn't appear to care what Unesco thinks.

What matters more than heritage, it seems, is shopping and new jobs in new shops. Liverpool is no museum: it wants a global skyscrapers and luxury brands. This is a little unfair, yet the city – architecturally a curate's egg (even around Giles Gilbert Scott's magisterial cathedral should aim a lot higher than the glossy banality of Liverpool Waters. A concern for local heritage proves just how innovative and memorable the city's architecture has been, whether in the design of the Three Graces, the Albert Docks or Freddie Gibberd's space capsule-style Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King. Why give up the ghost?

Meanwhile, and aside from a new generation of ultra-modern factories, shipyards, skilled jobs, schools and whatever local people suggest, what Liverpool needs is close attention to its housing stock and to its dilapidated inner suburbs.

Imagine if the kind of intelligence Le Corbusier applied to the Unité d'Habitation in the late 1940s housing scheme in Marseilles, another great and often run-down maritime city, could be resurrected in contemporary form in Liverpool. From inside, looking out, this magnificent housing block has the feel of a great concrete liner anchored between the mountains, the city and the sea. Today, Unité d'Habitation is lived in by professional people, artists, architects, academics and writers. They have come to appreciate the artistry and quality of a building originally intended to house a mix of local people. Marseilles has long needed more buildings like this, instead of the myriad low quality, global-style high-rise blocks that mar its skyline.

Often photographed to look monumental and morose, a lovely image of the roof and paddling pool of Unité d'Habitation by Neil Dusheiko, director of Neil Dusheiko Architectst has won the Architecture and People category award in the Architect's Eye photography competition. The awards were given this week at a ceremony hosted by competition organisers International Art Consultants.

The winner of the Architecture and Place category was Simon Kennedy, a freelance architect and lecturer at the Bartlett school of architecture, who photographed the condemned early 1970s Heygate Estate in south London.

Jack Pringle, chairman of the judges, noted that ""The two winning photographs, both of modernist designs, demonstrate carefully and beautifully, the striking contrast between the vibrant success of the Le Corbusier building and the lifeless failure of the Heygate Estate.""

Unite d'Habitation was a huge influence on the design of Britain's finest post-war housing estate, the Barbican. This challenging and imposing landscaped development has echoes of English baroque masters such as John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor, too, as well as Edwin Lutyens and other architects who helped inform Chamberlin, Powell and Bon. The achievement of these architects – shadowy figures today – has been brought to fresh life by the Elain Harwood's thoughtful book Chamberlin, Powell & Bon. It would be hard to imagine any British city paying for this kind of development today, particularly as the building of an Arts Centre was considered more important than shiny shops.

To consider how we might rethink the development of our cities, the Architectural Review has announced a Battleground for Ideas at the Royal College of Art. Ranging over questions of Style, Technology, Theory and Humanity, the season begins on 6 December (appropriately in the lead-up to Christmas) with Consumption. This British obsession, and one that could tear hearts and cities in every way, will be discussed by Ricky Burdett and Joseph Rykwert.

After the boom in the early years of the millennium, an era of paralysis lies ahead, according to Rab Bennetts.

""I am pessimistic about the way cutbacks in building will affect the country,"" he said. ""I think the government has underestimated the impact on the economy.""

Bennetts suspects that the £100m redevelopment of the RST, which is due for completion in the autumn, may prove to be the last great public project in a ""golden age"" of lottery funding.

""Lottery grants for this scale of work are disappearing because the private sector is no longer in a position to match the funding,"" he explained. ""So this theatre at Stratford may well be the last of its kind. Even the planned expansion of Tate Modern has a question mark over it and other similar projects are being wound up.""

The biggest blow to the profession will come from the withdrawal of funding for school improvements, Bennetts believes, but the additional freeze on new cultural centres and public spaces will stop modern Britain in its tracks.

""The loss of around 715 school projects in one hit, with lots more to come, will have a lasting impact. Although I am sure there is truth in claims there was too much bureaucracy involved, there was a lot of dilapidation and the work was needed.""

After the high-profile projects that redefined the urban landscape under New Labour, such as the London Eye, Tate Modern and the redevelopment of Gateshead, Bennetts says architects fear a blight on their profession that will be followed by the collapse of many construction firms as private and government schemes are shelved.

""When we had the last deep recesssion, the building and construction industry lost half a million people and I don't think they ever came back. We are talking about a permanent loss of jobs and skills. And construction is the second biggest industry in the country, so of course it can depress the whole economy.""

Bennetts, who rebuilt the Hampstead Theatre in north London and designed Brighton Library, runs an architectural practice based in London and Edinburgh with his wife and partner, Denise. In 2005 they won the contract to redesign Elisabeth Scott's 1932 theatre in Stratford, the home of the RSC. Theatre-goers are due to take their seats for the first time in the new, more intimate auditorium in November, but Bennetts fears that it will be the last such opening for several years.

""I wish there could be some kind of flywheel that could stabilise the extremes of building in times of both boom and bust. Clearly, some of the buildings that went up over the last 10 years weren't necessary and were just monuments to their creators. But although there were excesses, it will look like a golden age,"" he added.

Like the threatened Tate extension, a hoped-for transformation of Piece Hall in Halifax is the kind of public scheme described by Bennetts that may suffer. Last week the people of the Yorkshire town learned that plans to turn one of their most historic buildings into a £16m European-style piazza could be scaled back due to lack of funds. In March the local council was awarded £239,700 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to draw up blueprints before a further £7m was committed. Now there are fears that a promise of an extra £3m from Yorkshire Forward, the regional development agency, may not be honoured as the agency is replaced in a government shake-up.

In the 1980s, when the post-war programme of public works had well and truly finished, the only high-profile modern project to be built was Richard Rogers's London headquarters for Lloyd's of London. Private enterprise eventually signalled the future with the development of the tower at Canary Wharf. When the annual Stirling Prize for architecture was set up in 1996, the contenders on the shortlist were a modest selection of office buildings, humble house conversions and small-scale university facilities.

Money began to flow again when New Labour began to make liberal use of the key Conservative legacy: the National Lottery. The London Eye, Tate Modern, the redeveloped Royal Opera House and the covering of the Great Court of the British Museum all changed the look and the mood of the capital before private entreprise weighed in with glamorous projects such as the Swiss Re tower, popularly known as the Gherkin.

Similarly bold schemes went forward across the country – Scotland finally got its expensive new parliament building and Glasgow was given the Clyde Auditorium, known as the Armadillo.",The designer of the new Shakespeare theatre in Stratford says it could be the last great public project for years,45.9,0.9500000000000001,2.95,high,high,mixed,architecture

This year, in a way, he finished it.

Mr. Wilson, the mastermind of the Beach Boys, had envisioned an album that would merge pop hooks and elaborately composed interludes, with allusive lyrics by Van Dyke Parks that encompassed romance, American history and the alchemical elements.

""Smile"" was to be even more ambitious than Mr. Wilson's ""Pet Sounds,"" the intricately orchestrated, structurally far-reaching 1966 album that the Beatles tried to top with ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" More than 400,000 ""Smile"" album covers were printed.

But ""Smile"" turned into a nightmare for Mr. Wilson, who was spiraling toward a nervous breakdown and struggling with drugs and with personal demons that would envelop him for decades. The other members of the Beach Boys had grown dubious about the commercial prospects of the increasingly complex music and lyrics. There was rancor from Mr. Wilson's father, Murry, a frustrated musician who had beaten him during his childhood, and there were legal battles with the Beach Boys' label, Capitol Records. Mr. Wilson had grown reclusive and increasingly bizarre: he ordered eight truckloads of beach sand dumped around his piano at home so he could wiggle his toes in it for inspiration.

After 85 recording sessions, including more than two dozen for the song ""Heroes and Villains"" alone, Mr. Wilson abandoned ""Smile,"" and it turned into the most famous unheard album in pop history. ""I thought it was too weird, I thought it was too druggie influenced, I thought the audience wouldn't get it,"" Mr. Wilson said in an interview.

What remains of the original ""Smile"" are songs that appeared in different versions on subsequent Beach Boys albums -- among them ""Good Vibrations,"" ""Heroes and Villains,"" ""Surf's Up,"" ""Cabinessence"" and ""Wind Chimes"" -- and fragments of session tapes. But after reworking ""Pet Sounds"" for a triumphant concert tour in 2000, Mr. Wilson decided to return to ""Smile.""

This year, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Parks, a 10-piece band and additional strings and horns resurrected the album from shards and memories. After performing a live version in concert in Europe, they returned to the studio to make an entirely new recording of ""Smile"": 17 intricate, multifaceted, enigmatic songs, grouped into three suites, sometimes linked by recurring themes. The album will be released by Nonesuch on Sept. 28, and Mr. Wilson will perform a concert version of ""Smile"" on a monthlong American tour that begins on Sept. 30 in Minneapolis and reaches Carnegie Hall on Oct. 12 and 13.

The European reviews were rapturous. ""The music echoed everything from Philip Glass to Kurt Weill to Chuck Berry,"" a reviewer wrote in The Daily Telegraph when ""Smile"" was performed in London. ""Leonard Bernstein said Brian Wilson was one of the greatest composers of the 20th century. He was not wrong."" A critic for the Guardian referred to ""the groundbreaking complexity and sophistication"" of ""Smile,"" saying that the concert ""made it seem like the grandest of American symphonies.""

Mr. Wilson's fragility was clear at the concerts -- he sometimes needs help getting on and off the stage -- and it is evident in conversations with him. He is 62, and the years of mental illness and drugs have left him shaky at times, a tall, hefty man with sad, hollow eyes. Sitting upright and tense in the library of his home in a gated community atop Beverly Hills, or talking on the telephone, Mr. Wilson often speaks in terse sentences and monosyllables. His speech is occasionally slurred; he sometimes seems lost in his own world. At other times, he speaks strongly and comfortably.

""I love life,"" he said. ""The odds were against me, of course.""

Mr. Wilson has said that he wanted to release ""Smile"" as a legacy before he died, to close the most painful chapter in his troubled life.

""It was finally ready to be finished, ready to be accepted,"" he said. ""We thought it was too advanced for people at that time. We think people are now ready to understand where it was coming from. Back then, no one was ready for it.""

Echoing Mr. Wilson, his friend and collaborator, Mr. Parks, said: ""There are intimations of mortality here, intimations about the end of his performing cycle. With these intimations, decisions become profoundly more difficult.

""I get the impression that Brian knew he was running out of time and if he was going to present the work he'd have to make a decision to do it and no longer be embarrassed that he had followed his own madness as a 24-year-old composer. This is inexorably a highly personal move and a musical move.""

Mr. Wilson, whose personal life was a shambles from the 1960's to the 1980's, said that his wife of nine years, Melinda Ledbetter, had given him a serenity that had long eluded him. ""She's inspired me,"" he said. ""She's inspired me to write music. My children inspire me.""

Mr. Wilson and Ms. Ledbetter live quietly in Beverly Hills with three young adopted children, on whom he dotes. (Mr. Wilson also has two grown daughters from his first marriage, Carnie and Wendy Wilson, who sing in the group Wilson Phillips.)

Ms. Ledbetter, a one-time auto saleswoman, met Mr. Wilson in 1986 when she sold him a Cadillac, what she calls ""a really ugly brown Seville,"" in a showroom in Santa Monica. They dated sporadically and married in 1995. A friendly, straightforward woman, Ms. Ledbetter said her husband's severe emotional problems dated to his childhood and his abusive father. Mr. Wilson is deaf in one ear, which may be the result of childhood beatings.

""He was a very mean man; he'd beat me physically, but mostly mentally he beat me,"" Mr. Wilson said of his father, who died in 1973. ""He was our manager when we started but was so hard to live with that we fired him.""

Ms. Ledbetter said: ""Brian is mentally ill. He suffers from depression and he was never treated -- and when somebody is mentally ill from that early on and it goes untreated, then it makes it more difficult."" It was only after doctors at the University of California, Los Angeles, prescribed antidepressants that Mr. Wilson began to improve.","Brian Wilson recording Smile is finally finished after 37 years and will be released on Sept 28; was to be even more ambitious than Pet Sounds, intricately orchestrated, structurally far-reaching 1966 album, but Smile turned into nightmare for Wilson, who was spiraling toward nervous breakdown and struggling with drugs; after numerous recording sessions, Wilson abandoned Smile and it turned into most famous unheard album in pop history; photo (M)",16.1851851852,0.9382716049000001,4.0987654321,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

But for several days last week its fairytale towers had disappeared behind an acrid grey pall. With the thermometer stuck at a record-shattering 40C and the smog hidden by smoke from the burning marshes outside the city, this was a hellish Moscow that none of its residents had ever seen before.

I was in the city to give a talk at a new school, the Strelka Institute of Architecture, Media and Design. Located just across the river from the cathedral, the Strelka occupies the garages of the former Red October chocolate factory, which until two years ago had been producing chocolate on that site since the late 19th century. The school only opened earlier this summer but already it's one of the liveliest nightspots in the city, with film screenings, clubs and a restaurant frequented by Moscow's glamorous media set. If you're thinking that this doesn't sound much like a school, then you'd have a point, but we'll address that later. In all other senses the sight of a former industrial complex being turned into a cultural hotspot is one that we've been accustomed to in Europe and the US for several decades. In Russia, however, it's a more recent phenomenon.

One reason is that the gradual switch from an industrial to a services economy didn't begin until the Yeltsin years. And it was only around the turn of the millennium that developers started to speculate on factories (the more unscrupulous ones earned the description ""raiders""). The other factor in the slow speed of the post-industrial project is that the Russians appear to value new things more than old ones.

Any sightseers embarking on a tour of Moscow's avant-garde architecture from the early 20th century had better brace themselves for a catalogue of degradation. The more hallowed the building in the architectural history books, the greater its decrepitude. Take the Narkomfin building, designed by Moisei Ginzburg with Ignaty Milnis in 1928 to house the workers of the commissariat of finance. This radical apartment block, which spearheaded the idea of collective living, is one of the most important surviving constructivist buildings. And it is literally crumbling – indeed it's in such a sorry state that I was amazed to find that people still live in it. Then there is another constructivist masterpiece, Konstantin Melnikov's Rusakov workers' club of 1929, with its muscular geometric profile. It's still as dramatic as ever but empty now except for an Azerbaijani restaurant that has attached its own folksy timber entrance (with lurid neon signage) to the unforgettable facade.

But it is not just the early modernist heritage of Moscow that is unloved. Even the pride of a more recent Soviet past is going to seed. The All-Russia Exhibition Centre (VDNKh), the expo site in the north of the city that was a town-sized advertisement of Soviet achievements, is today a rather seedy theme park. None of its grandiose pavilions still contain anything worth seeing. The grandest, announced by a Tupolev rocket in the forecourt, is the 1966 Space Pavilion. It now houses a garden centre that would embarrass your average parish hall, let alone this vaulted cathedral to the Soviet space programme. Under the dome, the giant portrait of Yuri Gagarin has a sheet draped over it. I asked a local why and he answered simply: ""Shame."" It would dishonour the legendary cosmonaut to look out over this mess.

This is the climate in which the Russian post-industrial project is taking shape. Preservation is not a major preoccupation here, which is ironic considering that much of the post-communist architecture has been built to look old (it's known unofficially as the ""Luzhkov style"", after Moscow's long-serving mayor). And yet one fifth of Moscow is made up of industrial sites – think of the impact that Tate Modern had on London's cultural scene and then imagine how much potential Moscow has. But destroy-and-rebuild is the model favoured here, with over 1,000 historical buildings knocked down in the last decade. There's no pressure from heritage bodies and no incentives to convert industrial buildings. Indeed, there tend to be disincentives, such as the regulation that only new buildings can qualify for class A office status. It's no wonder that developers have been either demolishing the factories to build luxury apartment blocks or turning them into business parks.

In the last few years, however, things have started to change. For one thing, the recession has put the brakes on developers, allowing nimbler entrepreneurs to slip in. The Red October factory, for instance, was meant to be turned into a luxury residential zone called Golden Island, with buildings by Norman Foster (much beloved of Russia) and Jean Nouvel. Only the credit crunch enabled the Strelka's founders to lease their site. But there is also a new player on the Moscow property scene: the oligarch's wife, who knows only too well from the international circuit how to turn defunct industry into cultural prestige. One such is Dasha Zhukova, Roman Abramovich's wife, who two years ago turned Melnikov's temple-like Bakhmetevsky bus garage of 1927 into an art centre called Garage. Last week it was holding a Rothko retrospective, the kind of show that normally only major museums can handle.

On a grander scale, though less refined architecturally, are the cultural developments in the Kursky industrial area. Here there is Winzavod, a red-brick wine factory built in the 1860s. It was bought by Roman Trotsenko to turn into offices but again his wife, Sofia, saw the potential for a cultural centre. Today it's full of galleries, showrooms and creative studio spaces. And right next door to it is what used to be the Arma gasworks, which supplied the gas for Moscow's streetlights. Now its four brick gasometers are home to a clutch of nightclubs, creative agencies and publishing houses. In a strange hangover from Soviet bureaucracy, you have to show your passport to enter and you're not allowed to take photographs, which somehow is not quite in the spirit of the place.

Here's the question: is it to be left to the oligarchs' wives to deliver on all this potential cultural programming? One Muscovite I met referred to Garage and Vinzavod rather dismissively as ""toys for rich people"". ""Still,"" he added, ""they could just be buying more yachts.""

Perhaps the Strelka offers a different model. The founders of this postgraduate design school, with a curriculum designed by Rem Koolhaas, are at least using their wealth to invest in the next generation. And one way that they are making the school's name (while recouping some funds) is as a social hotspot. In fact, the Strelka is the kind of hybrid that could probably only exist in the turbo-capitalist experiment of Moscow: one part ideology, one part philanthropy (the education will be free) and one part the place to be seen. If the school succeeds, then while Russia may have come late to the post-industrial party, it will have contributed something new to the rather predictable formats we know so well in Europe. Meanwhile, locals are paying it a classic Muscovite compliment: ""It's so not like Moscow.""",Justin McGuirk: The city's avant-garde masterpieces are falling into ruin.

In recent days, Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who owned the 47-story tower, received word that his insurance company would not contest his $861 million claim, clearing the way for construction. Yesterday, Mr. Silverstein had workers begin erecting a construction fence around the site, on the north side of Vesey Street.

Mr. Silverstein's insurance company, Industrial Risk Insurers, had been investigating whether a 6,000-gallon oil tank that had been installed in the building in the late 90's had significantly contributed to the collapse of the tower on Sept. 11. The oil tank was installed for the Giuliani administration's emergency crisis center there.

Both Mr. Silverstein and state officials had been worried that if the insurance company refused to pay the claim, the project would falter, sending a gloomy message about the future of Lower Manhattan.

But the two sides resolved the issues amicably. Dean Davison, a spokesman for the insurance company, said that Industrial Risk was ''moving toward payment of the claims.''

Mr. Silverstein said excavation would start in the coming days, while pile-driving and a formal groundbreaking ceremony would occur sometime in June.

''It's resolved,'' Mr. Silverstein said yesterday morning with a sigh of relief. ''A lot of things are beginning to happen.''

According to executives who have been briefed on Mr. Silverstein's negotiations with the insurance company, there is one remaining issue: the developer wants Industrial Risk to pay the claim in one lump sum, rather than in periodic installments, so that he, in turn, can pay off his existing mortgage at 7 World Trade Center. Either way, the executive said, Mr. Silverstein should not have a problem financing the new tower.

Mr. Silverstein's latest plan calls for a somewhat taller but less bulky skyscraper designed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill. The location of the tower will be shifted slightly to the south to allow for the restoration of Greenwich Street. And the project will accommodate a Con Edison substation. Two substations that relayed electricity to much of Lower Manhattan were destroyed Sept. 11 when 7 World Trade Center collapsed.

The project still requires approval by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the land. But Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and New York's top economic development official, has long encouraged Mr. Silverstein to rebuild 7 World Trade Center. The developer also said he would continue to work with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency created to oversee the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan. Although it has no formal role in the project, the corporation has successfully pressed the developer and Con Edison in the reconfiguration of the building.

''This shows that you can get good things to happen in Lower Manhattan by working together,'' said Louis R. Tomson, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.

Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, said that many civic groups were still hoping that Mr. Silverstein had come up with an environmentally responsible design that included reductions in energy use, elimination of toxic materials and the use of natural light and air.

At the 16-acre World Trade Center site on the south side of Vesey Street, the development corporation is playing a more critical role. The Port Authority owns the land and Mr. Silverstein controls the lease for that site as well. But the development corporation is charged with the politically sensitive task of creating a memorial for the 2,824 people killed at the trade center and taking into account a public consensus for what should be built on the land.

Mr. Silverstein backed off on his original proposal to simply rebuild the 10.5-million-square-foot trade center, with either two or four large towers, after community groups, civic organizations and the families of victims of the terrorist attack objected. In recent weeks, Mr. Silverstein has kept silent about his design for the site, while the development corporation has been drawing up its own plans.

The Port Authority and the development corporation are reviewing applications from 13 groups of urban planners, architects and transportation experts interested in become consultants on a development plan. The Port Authority will select the winning proposal in two weeks and develop a plan by July, a speedy timetable that has drawn criticism from some who say it does not leave enough time to create an imaginative design.

Work is moving forward on rebuilding the PATH train tunnels and a subway station destroyed in the attack. But that is far less visible than a new tower.

State and city officials considered the rebuilding of 7 World Trade Center to be less politically sensitive. It was important, they said, to rebuild the electrical substation by July 2003, and to reassure financial firms that had fled the area that Lower Manhattan would be rebuilt quickly.

''This will be a concrete and positive statement about the viability of new commercial redevelopment in Lower Manhattan,'' said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York.

He contacted Eric de Maré, the visionary chronicler of the postwar British landscape, then in retirement. ""It was like watching an old gunslinger back in action,"" says Hopkins. ""The first shots were a little off the mark. Then he found his aim and was bang on target. Those photographs are some of my proudest possessions.""

Richard MacCormac, architect of the Ruskin Library in Lancaster and other jewel-like buildings, shares Hopkins's reverence. ""Did Eric de Maré influence me?"" he says. ""Funny you should ask. I've just been using his shot of 'skyscraper' fishermen's sheds at Hastings as inspiration for a housing scheme.""

This foreboding image shows a cluster of improbably tall sheds with pitched roofs, all tilting haphazardly. Referred to as ""skyscrapers"" by De Maré, their scale is revealed by two young women floating by in summery frocks. It was taken in 1956, when De Maré, an architect-turned-photographer born in London of Swedish parents, was in his mid-40s and working for the Architectural Review, on a mission to record venerable yet largely forgotten industrial buildings. The shot seems to be saying that architecture, no matter how unexpected, is for everyone: the women couldn't be less like the fishermen for whom the sheds were built, yet they seem in curious harmony with the hulking structures that they are ambling past almost without noticing.

Breweries, bridges, boathouses, windmills, watermills, naval yards – De Maré's shots of them would eventually become the backbone of a 1958 book that was to prove profoundly influential: The Functional Tradition in Early Industrial Buildings, written by JM Richards. The fact that an architect of MacCormac's stature is, half a century on, still using De Maré's work for inspiration says much about its power; Norman Foster calls his photographs ""a social conscience of visual values – more valid than ever"".

De Maré's finest images are currently on show at the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) in London. His sublime prints record delightful textile mills and canal bridges that make remarkably modern use of materials. No decoration. No stucco. No classical airs and graces. To architects of MacCormac's generation, already questioning the cold-blooded modernism they had been spoon-fed in tutorials, De Maré offered the shock of the old. ""We'd been brought up to hate flamboyant Victorian design,"" says Hopkins, whose own buildings have an earthy, industrial look. ""But we hadn't been properly aware of this powerful industrial architecture that was as functional, honest and fit for purpose as any new architecture we had been shown from 1920s France and Germany. It was gloriously, robustly physical – all bones and sinews.""

One of De Maré's finest images is of St Edward's church in Yorkshire, overlooked by the cooling towers of Ferrybridge B Power Station. It is a magnificent composition: the power of the medieval church and its God seem on the point of being overwhelmed by another type of power. Both buildings, however, are beautiful – and demonstrate De Maré's love of the vernacular, of buildings whose creators received little recognition, yet which electrify the architectural imagination.

Hopkins bought De Maré's extensive archive before the photographer's death in 2002 at the age of 91, and gave it to the Architectural Association. The collection stands as a reminder of how powerful architectural photography can be – especially when charged with a moving and timely idea.","Eric de Maré's sublime photographs of British industrial buildings forced postwar architects to look again at the landscape.

But rarely does an owner refund a portion of the rent as compensation for the inconvenience created by continuing construction.

That is what happened at the Harkness on 61 West 62nd Street, a 27-floor apartment building that stands a block away from Lincoln Center.

''We did this in consideration for the people who moved in when thebuilding wasn't ready,'' said Joseph V. G iffuni of the refund. ''We went across the board and used a pro-rata formula.''

In mid-July, Mr. Giffuni offered tenants who moved into the Harkness before July three quarters off the January rent, 60% off February, 50% off March, 25% off April and May, and 10% off June.Monthly rents range from $775 to $1,950.

He said difficulties in erecting the building's exterior walls put the structure's completion date six months behind schedule. Construction was still going on in January in some parts of the building when tenants began moving in.

Some of the tenants who moved in early in the year said here were problems with heating, air conditioning, and inadequate service. They also complained about poor quality of finishing in the apartments and hallways.

Mr. Giffuni said that it was possible some tenants might have lacked heat occasionally, and that he had heard complaints that the doorman wasn't announcing visitors. Mainly, Mr. Giffuni said, there were ''a lot of minor complaints. Most people are happy.''

This summer, the inconvenience drove a group of tenant to start a rent strike. Mr. Giffuni said they numbered under 30. ''I don't even consider it a rent strike,'' he said.

The group's lawyer, Kent Karlsson, was unsure how many tenants had undertaken a rent strike, but he suggested it was around one quarter of the of the occupants in the Harkness.

''This is typical of new building problems,'' said Mr. Karlsson. Mr. Karlsson said most of his clients rejected the offer because they believed that a refund did nothing to solve their complaints about inadequate maintenance and security. He said that he would be meeting with Mr. Giffuni on those questions soon.

Tenants of the Harkness differ on how well Mr. Giffuni has dealt with their inconvenience. Marina Lansky, a tenant organizer in the building, said she didn't have heat in the winter. Seven robberies occured, she said, because of poor security. ''We basically moved into a shell,'' she said.

One couple, who asked that their names not be used, came to Manhattan from upstate New York and signed a lease that was to begin on Dec.1, 1980 and were then told things would be ''a few days late'' by representatives of J.I. Sopher, the rental agent.

''Then they said January first,'' said the wife.''Nothing was ready. My husband had to rent a furnished apartment.'' When they moved in in February, they said they found that a hot water fixture had not been properly connected. In addition, she said, ''The walls were stained and wet. The apartment was dirty. There was paint everywhere. The halls weren't done till after Easter.''

After May they joined the rent strike. Asked about the broker's role in renting apartments in an uncompleted building, Hank Sopher, president of J.I. Sopher & Co., said: ''At some time you have to project when it's going to be ready.'' If tenants are dissatisfied with the arrangements, he said, ''we offer them their money back or we can extend their lease.''

Marcia Y. Cohn, who came from Pennsylvania, found the building so ''intolerable'' after arriving in January that she went away until March. Even then, she said, it was not much better.

Miss Cohn found the apartment badly finished, with paint splattered on cabinets and fixtures and excess grouting in the bathroom. But after she complained, she said the management was very good about finishing the apartment. Like the Dees, she was not charged for the first two months of the year. That, she said, was very fair. She accepted the refund offer: ''When it came, I really hadn't expected to see it.''

Despite the outstanding complaints, Mr. Giffuni said that things were now running smoothly. ''It's all rented up,'' he said. ''It's a beautiful building.''","Tenant complaints about new apartments are nothing new in an age when owners want tenants to move in as quickly as possible.

Where has all that money gone? Looking from the street, it's hard to believe a single penny has been spent on this glorious early Victorian building that contrasts so strikingly with the medieval and neo-Gothic buildings it faces. The Ashmolean – an architectural wonder by Charles Robert Cockerell that fuses ancient Roman, Greek and English baroque design – seems all but unchanged since the day it opened in 1845.

This, though, is part of the conjuring trick Christopher Brown, director of the museum since 1998, and his architect Rick Mather have pulled off. While Cockerell's facades have been spruced up a little and the magnificent central door once again forms the museum's principal entrance (a side door was used for many years), those millions have been spent almost entirely out of sight.

It is behind Cockerell's neo-classical facades that a new world opens up, one that radically transforms the scale of this, Britain's oldest public museum. Beyond the Grecian entrance lobby, Mather's unexpectedly large six-storey extension might easily be considered the tail that wags the Ashmolean dog, were it not so restrained and refined. Mather has shoehorned a huge, modern concrete-and-glass box into the courtyard behind Cockerell's creation. From the surrounding streets, this generous extension is invisible; the streetscape, a heady mix of medieval, Georgian, Regency and Victorian Oxford, is untouched.

By any standards, this is a clever sleight of hand, since Mather's extension actually doubles the museum's display space. Its six floors – one underground – boast no fewer than 39 new galleries, including four for temporary exhibitions, together with an education centre, offices and Oxford's first rooftop restaurant. Yet, for all its space, clarity and light, this is a complex design. The galleries are set on two different axes (north-south and east-west) over the six floors. Some are three metres high, others six. They come together like a multidimensional jigsaw puzzle, the pieces connected by enclosed glass bridges passing through and over a great central stairwell, lit from above. This stairwell is itself a quietly spectacular space, one side of which is given over to a gleaming white architectural cliff into which are set flight after flight of white Portland stone stairs, linking the tiers of galleries and the rooftop restaurant. While the geometry is intricate, the effect is relaxed, engaging and generous.

""The idea,"" says Mather, ""is to entice visitors to make a great figure of eight – up, down and through the galleries. The contents of each can be glimpsed from the one before, through openings and windows. So you get pulled along. And, wherever you go, whatever you're looking at, the central stairwell, which holds the design together, is easy to find. We know a lot about 'museum fatigue', so we've made a sequence of spaces that, hopefully, will keep this to a minimum.""

Wherever they walk, on whatever crisscrossing floor or bridge, visitors will circle back to that six-storey stairwell, only to be lured into ever more galleries, each presenting more of the Ashmolean's rich collection than has ever been seen before. ""Much of what we have has been in store for donkey's years,"" says Brown, the Ashmolean's 17th director. The first was Robert Plot in 1683, when the museum was housed in what is now the University of Oxford's Museum of History and Science, a building commissioned for the celebrated antiquary Elias Ashmole's collection of curiosities. ""Our problem was that the Cockerell building, although very fine, is actually tall and narrow. It's not that roomy.

""In the early 1890s, to get more space, the courtyard was filled with five pitched-roof sheds, rather industrial affairs rushed up by the local architect HW Moore. These were never satisfactory. A part of one shed's roof blew off a few years ago. They were, though, listed Grade I, because they were seen as part of the historically important Cockerell design. So they might have stood in our way. Luckily, the conservationists let us off lightly when we proposed demolition. Once we managed to convince everyone of what we could do with the space, without it being visible from the surrounding streets, we were up and running.""

In fact, Brown has been working on the project for 11 years. But then his is a complicated museum, one that houses collections of both art and archaeology. Here you will find Constable cloudscapes and pre-Raphaelites, along with paintings by Dutch masters and Picasso. Balancing these are Greek and Roman sculptures, fragments from Minoan excavations, Middle Eastern robes and even a wooden doorway from Yemen donated by Lawrence of Arabia.

Then there are Anglo-Saxon jewels, prized majolica pottery, and the famous ""Messiah"" Stradivarius violin no one is allowed to play (""A condition of its being here,"" says Brown. ""Rather sad, don't you think?""). Guy Fawkes's lantern (yes, the very one he carried with him on the gunpowder plot) is there, too, as well as antique bowls from Iraq and Iran, and Chinese political posters from the Cultural Revolution . . . and so the list goes on. The only things missing are a Cézanne, stolen (probably to order) from the Ashmolean in 1999; and what was one of the museum's greatest treasures – the world's only stuffed dodo. Had it not been allowed to rot back in the 18th century, it would have been quite a crowd-puller today.

The genius of 'fat walls'

When it reopens on 7 November, the new Ashmolean should certainly engage a wider public than before, although Brown is cautious when discussing visitor numbers. ""Best not to get carried away,"" he says, suggesting a yearly figure of 500,000, which would be an increase of 100,000. It seems a conservative estimate: this is the first major modern museum in Oxford, a city of wealthy yet small independent colleges that rarely join together to shape a big building for public events.

While Mather's Ashmolean addition is a magical combination of cool stone, oak floors, spruce plywood, polished plaster, steel, glass and zinc, all its elements have been brought together with a lightness of touch. This is a characteristic of Mather buildings, from his Zen restaurants of the 1980s to the new Towner Gallery in Eastbourne, but here it is also down to the way the architects and engineers have tucked the mechanical and electrical services into the walls. So floor-to-ceiling heights are as generous as they can be, while what Mather calls his ""fat walls"" double as recessed exhibition spaces. The result is a building in which every last inch is hard at work, while giving the opposite impression.

Brown and Mather have not only brought fresh life to the Ashmolean; they have also given Oxford a fine new public place where visitors can meet, eat and while away rainy days rummaging happily through one of the country's great treasure chests. The fact that this enchanting museum is also an active seat of research and scholarship only adds to its lustre, while the reality of seeing so many objects – squirrelled away for too many years – out on display will make the Ashmolean a museum to return to, time and again.",It's Britain's oldest museum – and it's just had a thrilling revamp.

Even though his health-care website is still in need of dire repair, President Obama was in the port of New Orleans earlier this month talking about repairing a much bigger problem: the nation's aging highways, bridges and ports. Saying that 1 in 9 bridges are structurally deficient and more than 40 percent of major highways are congested, Obama repeated his call for major infrastructure investment, but it's unclear how or if that will happen.

Announced during his State of the Union speechin February, Obama's Fix-It-First program calls for $40 billion in spending on a backlog of urgent repairs and upgrades. That would follow $31 billion that went into infrastructure as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. But those sums are dwarfed by the $3.6 trillion in investment the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) says is needed by 2020.

In its 2013 Report Card for America's Infrastructure, released in March, the ASCE gave the nation a grade of D, with aviation, roads and transit getting D's; and ports and rail a C and C, respectively. The overall grade was a slight improvement from D in 2009, but the group emphasized in a report that ""America's critical infrastructure—principally, its roads, bridges, drinking water systems, mass transit systems, schools, and systems for delivering energy—may soon fail to meet society's needs.""

With its job-creation allure, infrastructure spending can command bipartisan support, but that doesn't necessarily mean new funding is readily forthcoming. Dating to the interstate construction of the 1950s, the Highway Trust Fund finances highway and mass-transit investment with an 18.4-cent excise tax on gas and other fuels, but that hasn't been raised in 20 years; due to inflation, the fund's purchasing power is only about 62 percent of what it was.","America gets a D+ for its crumbling roads, bridges, other infrastructure.

It has a wonderful sense of light and openness, and the site itself is a joy. It is beautiful, designed with all the optimism of the early 1950s. I remember going to the second ever concert there, when I was six: Friday Night is Music Night. One looked at it with total wonderment - the gorgeous wood, the materials, the colour.

There have been so many schemes to smarten up the South Bank, some more extreme than others. But all they need to do with the Festival Hall is restore it to its original state - to cherish it and help it survive. The shops in the foyer should be removed, and the seats in the auditorium badly need replacing. They have got rather worn since they started programming pop concerts with wilder audiences. Another thing that needs fixed is the drainage. You get the most ghastly puddles when it rains.

Barbican, London Arguably, the Barbican is one of the most ghastly things in the history of mankind. That's not to say they don't put on wonderful exhibitions, concerts and theatre in the arts centre, which I visit frequently. But when I go there, I am reminded of a story about the pianist Alfred Brendel. He was performing in the Barbican Hall, and the concert was interrupted by a bomb scare. After the building was evacuated, he was found in a nearby Italian restaurant.

""Is everybody out?"" he asked.

""Now the bomb should go off,"" he retorted.

The Barbican is difficult to get to. You have to walk down a dreadful 100m tunnel to reach the main entrance. Once you're inside, the layout is problematic. You can find your way around only by following yellow lines painted on the ground. I find it very alienating, like a high-class version of a terrible postwar housing estate.

I'm always glad to get out of the complex. I always feel someone is going to leap out of the shadows and attack me. It is an absolute mystery to me why it is so successful.

We have an exceptional opportunity to create an inspirational building, and we should not let it slip. I have been interested in architecture since my early 20s and, though I have no remorse about studying law, had I done anything else it would have been architecture. I find it fascinating the way buildings combine the aesthetic with the functional, the way they can be embracing or offputting in their austerity, the way they impact on both the physical and social landscape.

Recently I visited the supreme court in Jerusalem. It seems to rise above the conflict and the jarring traditions that surround it; you feel that this wonderfully light and airy building is serving a greater purpose. In my role as chair of the British Council, I have visited a number of emerging democracies, and it is fascinating to see how countries react to the challenge of designing a supreme court. Moscow's, for instance, is all marble-halled grandeur, whereas South Africa's resonates with the sense that it is a result of a people's struggle to achieve justice for all: one comes from the top down, the other from the bottom up, so to speak. A supreme court for this country should reflect our highest aspirations for justice.

It certainly shouldn't go down the route of so many of the courts in this country, which are sheer hellholes. Southwark crown court in London has almost no natural light, a horrible canteen and it is dark and dank. In no way is it designed to cater to the people who matter most - those standing trial or giving evidence.

With its handsome train shed by Charles Fox, a magnificent entrance – the Euston Arch – designed by Philip Hardwick to mimic an ancient Greek propylaeum, and a sumptuous Great Hall (England's noblest waiting room) drawn up by Hardwick's son, Philip Charles Hardwick, the original Euston station was admired worldwide. Sadly, all this was churlishly demolished in 1961-2.

The current 1960s building has never been popular, and not just because of the loss of the Victorian station: nearly half a century on, there is still nowhere to sit in this airport-style ""terminal"" while waiting for trains that are strangely hidden out of sight.

The Aedas team will clear the station's clutter, add a mezzanine with new cafes and somewhere to sit overlooking the concourse, and generally make the building feel crisp, clear and clean. The project is meant to be temporary, although this turns on whether or not HS2, the new high-speed line from Birmingham to London, goes ahead. If it does, Euston may yet be rebuilt completely. But don't hold your breath: big talk in 2008 of an ambitious new station masterplanned by Allies and Morrison, designed by Foreign Office Architects, developed by British Land and with the Euston Arch brought back to life, came to nothing. Aedas's revamp may end up lasting a very long time.

If the renovation of Euston is, in part, being encouraged by the London 2012 Olympics, the redevelopment of Glasgow Queen Street station is being prodded on by the 2014 Commonwealth Games, although work on this Victorian station is not expected to be complete until 2015. A 1970s office block fronting the station will be demolished and the terminus will refaced with a glazed atrium and a direct link to the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre. If it was fashionable 50 years ago to turn railway stations into faux airport terminals, they are now on their way to becoming shopping malls, with eye-wateringly expensive trains attached.

Alejandro Zaera-Paolo of AZPA, a former partner of Foreign Office Architects (disbanded since the 2008 Euston plan), is in the running to design one or perhaps two stations for the new Galicia extension of Spain's high-speed AVE, at Ourense and Santiago de Compostela. Zaera-Polo's rivals at Ourense are Norman Foster, Richard Rogers and Eduardo Souto de Moura, while the shortlist for Santiago de Compostela includes David Chipperfield.

Biarritz station is quite some walk from the city's seafront on the Bay of Biscay. Here, the world of commuters gives way to sailing boats and surfboards and to the curious Cité de l'Océan et du Surf, opened this summer. Designed by Steven Holl with Solange Fabião, this museum of the sea is a poetic place where the architecture blurs into the waves and where you'll find a surfers' kiosk and a semi-enclosed space for performances and festivals. The building has just won a 2011 Emirates Glass LEAF award, an international prize for the world's best new buildings.

The Leaf awards' special commendation went to the gloriously colourful and playful University of Naples metro station (below), designed by Karim Rashid. These interiors will certainly take anyone's mind off the woes of commuting. Every staircase is an artwork, with each step offering a fraction that builds up to a whole, flight-long picture. Pop imagery abounds; it's like the psychedelic art shows of the 60s, at the time the new Euston opened. And very radical for a Metro station, even five decades on.

We've had trains and surfing, and now here's something for cyclists. The 2012 Olympic velodrome by Hopkins Architects is the favourite to win the RIBA Stirling prize. The winner of what the judges believe to be the best new building designed or built in Britain by a British-based practice is announced at a slap-up dinner at the Magna Science Adventure Centre, Rotherham, on Saturday night.

It looks like the artist Anish Kapoor has been let loose with his wax cannon again. But this, in fact, is what the making of Christmas looks like; this is the very heart of the real Santa’s workshop – thousands of miles from the North Pole, in the Chinese city of Yiwu.

Our yuletide myth-making might like to imagine that Christmas is made by rosy-cheeked elves hammering away in a snow-bound log cabin somewhere in the Arctic Circle. But it’s not. The likelihood is that most of those baubles, tinsel and flashing LED lights you’ve draped liberally around your house came from Yiwu, 300km south of Shanghai – where there’s not a (real) pine tree nor (natural) snowflake in sight.

Christened “China’s Christmas village”, Yiwu is home to 600 factories that collectively churn out over 60% of all the world’s Christmas decorations and accessories, from glowing fibre-optic trees to felt Santa hats. The “elves” that staff these factories are mainly migrant labourers, working 12 hours a day for a maximum of £200 to £300 a month – and it turns out they’re not entirely sure what Christmas is.

“Maybe it’s like [Chinese] New Year for foreigners,” says 19-year-old Wei, a worker who came to Yiwu from rural Guizhou province this year, speaking to Chinese news agency Sina. Together with his father, he works long days in the red-splattered lair, taking polystyrene snowflakes, dipping them in a bath of glue, then putting them in a powder-coating machine until they turn red – and making 5,000 of the things every day.

In the process, the two of them end up dusted from head to toe in fine crimson powder. His dad wears a Santa hat (not for the festive spirit, he says, but to stop his hair from turning red) and they both get through at least 10 face masks a day, trying not to breathe in the dust. It’s a tiring job and they probably won’t do it again next year: once they’ve earned enough money for Wei to get married, they plan on returning home to Guizhou and hopefully never seeing a vat of red powder again.

Packaged up in plastic bags, their gleaming red snowflakes hang alongside a wealth of other festive paraphernalia across town in the Yiwu International Trade Market, aka China Commodity City, a 4m sq m wonder-world of plastic tat. It is a pound shop paradise, a sprawling trade show of everything in the world that you don’t need and yet may, at some irrational moment, feel compelled to buy. There are whole streets in the labyrinthine complex devoted to artificial flowers and inflatable toys, then come umbrellas and anoraks, plastic buckets and clocks. It is a heaving multistorey monument to global consumption, as if the contents of all the world’s landfill sites had been dug-up, re-formed and meticulously catalogued back into 62,000 booths.

The complex was declared by the UN to be the “largest small commodity wholesale market in the world” and the scale of the operation necessitates a kind of urban plan, with this festival of commerce organised into five different districts. District Two is where Christmas can be found.

There are corridors lined with nothing but tinsel, streets throbbing with competing LED light shows, stockings of every size, plastic Christmas trees in blue and yellow and fluorescent pink, plastic pine cones in gold and silver. Some of it seems lost in translation: there are sheep in Santa hats and tartan-embroidered reindeer, and of course lots of that inexplicable Chinese staple, Father Christmas playing the saxophone.

It might look like a wondrous bounty, but the market’s glory days seem to have passed: it’s now losing out to internet giants like Alibaba and Made In China. On Alibaba alone, you can order 1.4m different Christmas decorations to be delivered to your door at the touch of a button. Yiwu market, by comparison, stocks a mere 400,000 products.

Aiming at the lower end of the market, Yiwu’s sales thrived during the recession, as the world shopped for cut-price festive fun, but international sales are down this year. Still, according to Cai Qingliang, vice chairman of the Yiwu Christmas Products Industry Association, domestic appetite is on the rise, as China embraces the annual festival of Mammon. Santa Claus, says the Economist, is now better known to most Chinese people than Jesus.

The beaming sales reps of Yiwu market couldn’t sound happier with their life sentence of eternal Christmastime. According to Cheng Yaping, co-founder of the Boyang Craft Factory, who runs a stall decked out like a miniature winter wonderland: “Sitting here every day, being able to look at all these beautiful decorations, is really great for your mood.”

It’s somehow unlikely that those on the other end of the production line, consigned to dipping snowflakes in red-swamped workshops for us to pick up at the checkout for 99p, feel quite the same way.","Inside the ‘Christmas village’ of Yiwu, there’s no snow and no elves, just 600 factories that produce 60% of all the decorations in the world",33.7666666667,0.7666666667,1.9666666667000001,medium,low,mixed,architecture

Nikolaus Pevsner published the first volume of his epic Buildings of England series, for Nottinghamshire. The extravagantly talented Spanish bridge designer, Santiago Calatrava, was born. Indeed, I owe my own existence to the mood of near euphoria that swept the capital as excited visitors to Battersea's new Pleasure Gardens pootled between Far Tottering and Oyster Creek on Rowland Emett's railway.

Meanwhile, back on the South Bank, there was the epochal Festival of Britain. Here Powell & Moya's earthbound Skylon, the model for half a million standard lamps later to appear in suburban lounges, pointed suggestively heavenwards to a technological future that never quite arrived. This 300ft metal structure, like the Britain of 1951, had no visible support nor any very practical purpose. At the festival a very young textile designer called Terence Conran worked on an exhibition stand for British Rayon. Then, on a Waterloo bombsite, the enduring centrepiece of the festival, the Royal Festival Hall, opened on 3 May.

Early next month, it reopens after a heroic refurbishment. While the temporary stuff of 1951 crumbled, the Festival Hall remained. As a structure, it was technically stretched, and maintenance was soon required. It has been buffed up before. In 1964 foyers and terraces were added to the riverside, extending the plan by 30ft. At the same time, poorly judged decorative tiles from 1951 were removed. The latest refurbishment is the work of architecture firm Allies and Morrison. There are new, much-needed, educational facilities, but the majority of their work is a highly ambitious but very subtle rehabilitation of the 1951 original. It is unusual in a normally egomaniacal architectural profession for a leading firm to dedicate itself to such patient revision of someone else's work. I asked Graham Morrison what visitors will notice:

'First impression will be of a restored clarity.' he said. 'The recovered transparency of the main foyer will remind everyone of the concept of the egg of the auditorium raised up in a box. The new works are not radical: they simply help reveal the original design.'

A new outbuilding on the west has liberated 35 per cent more public space. Western roof terraces become an aerial members' bar. Terence's successors, Conran and Partners, have designed a new river-view restaurant, affectionately named after the old Skylon. Interior colours get back to the more polychrome Scandinavian palette. The original carpet pattern has been dutifully copied (the old one dissected into rugs and sold off). There is new lighting, inside and out, by designers Speirs and Major.

Pleasant memories of 1951 bring into sharp contrast the muddle of the Millennium project where for six exciting but dismaying months in 1997 I was creative director - until I flounced out in protest at government-imposed mediocrity. This is not to say the festival was not politicised, only that it was politicised more intelligently. It was a conscious evocation of the Great Exhibition of 1851 of which Disraeli said it 'will be a boon to the Government, for it will make the public forget its misdeeds'. To doubters 1951 was a 'patriotic prank'; to the more supportive it was a 'tonic to the nation'. Brian Aldiss said: 'It has become an ancient enigma which we decode with difficulty.' Maybe, but it brought about great architecture and design. In this it was a marvellous success while the Millennium was a pitiable calamity.

A Festival of Britain was first proposed in 1943; the spirit of national renewal it was intended to capture was prototyped in a 1946 exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum called 'Britain Can Make It'. It addressed a nation of bruised but proud survivors, creating an optimistic mood that lasted a generation. It employed great artists. It was directed with energy and flair. A newspaperman called Gerald Barry was in overall charge but he delegated creative responsibility to the talented and ambitious architect Hugh Casson (1910-1999). And Casson worked wonders, leaving stuff that will forever be in the collective imagination.

But in the political background was Herbert Morrison, the son of a Brixton policeman, later cutely known as Lord Festival. He had become part-time secretary of the new London Labour Party in 1914. By 1919 he was Mayor of Hackney and elected to the LCC for East Woolwich in 1922. Morrison chose the South Bank site because it was near to 'his' County Hall. This muscular avatar of Old Labour was grandfather to the Peter Mandelson who became 'Dome Secretary' in the Blair dawn. Clement Attlee said of Morrison that he 'cannot distinguish between big things and little things'. His grandson, on Dome and other activities, could not, alas, distinguish between good and bad.

The Festival of Britain had a budget of £12 million against the Dome's £1 billion. It was publicised by two million leaflets in eight languages. Press ads appeared in 34 countries. Four liveried double-decker buses toured Europe and a converted aircraft carrier, the Campania, carried a floating festival around the nation's ports. Laurie Lee, a former staff member of the Ministry of Information, wrote the captions for 30,000 exhibits. Abram Games, the last master of the drawn lithograph, did the graphics. Casson was free to recruit the best designers in the country, including Misha Black, James Gardner, Ralph Tubbs, James Holland. When I tried to do the same in the Dome (which, coincidentally, has also been redeveloped, and is due to reopen as a vast entertainment venue in July), I was told we could not have foreigners.

In 1951 there was an appetite for quality. Even if, as critic Reyner Banham said, the English were not yet confident enough to enjoy themselves without being told to do so by Herbert Morrison. Blair and Mandelson tried the same 48 years later, telling us to shut up and enjoy patronising rubbish. 'There is no doubt,' the official 1951 publication boomed, 'that those who come will carry back with them a sense of Britain's continuing vitality as a creative force in the world today.' Weirdly, this was true. Robin and Lucienne Day and Ernest Race designed furniture for the Festival of Britain which became the synecdoche of British modernism in the Fifties. The Days designed the seating in the Royal Festival Hall, now happily restored. There was sculpture by Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Lynn Chadwick and Reg Butler. It was a sort of forced march into the future.

There are lessons here. While Fifties modernism is generally reviled, the public retains an overwhelming sense of affection for the Royal Festival Hall. Hitherto, Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall, built by Herbert Rowse between 1933 and 1939, was the only purpose-built concert hall of any ambition in the whole country. Maybe the optimism of its designers was passed on. Hugh Casson gave the job of lead designer to Leslie Martin (1908-1999) of the LCC Architects' Department, only 39 at the time and very taken with the Nordic example of Alvar Aalto and Gunnar Asplund. A 1948 sketch by Martin shows the design of the concert hall as the egg in a box described by Graham Morrison: the auditorium virtually floats in an envelope. But the great thing is the arrangement of interior space: the central staircase has a ceremonial feel and moves elegantly through the different levels of light and air. There is a sense of subtlety and freedom: it is friendly second-generation modernism, as if drawn by Osbert Lancaster.

The concert hall itself was an ambitious container for 3,000 people. The boxes - routinely described as looking like drawers pulled out in a hurried burglary - are cantilevered out in a seemingly arbitrary way, but none has a compromised sightline. The ceiling is wilfully sculptural, a conceit at the very edge of building technology and, as it turns out, way beyond the contemporary understanding of acoustics. But it was a thrilling building. Hugh Casson's daughter, Dinah, herself a distinguished architect and designer, told me: 'I was five when the festival opened. The hall is still fused with a deep sensation, not fully understood, of something very special. Apart from its architectural intelligence, there is a special warmth about it. It was a kind of oasis when everything else seemed to be grey and mean. This wasn't mean, neither was it splashy ... it was like climbing into one of the musical instruments we had come to hear.'

Indeed the 1951 concert hall was designed as an instrument in its own right, but the reach of the acousticians exceeded their grasp. A major element of the Allies and Morrison refurbishment is new acoustics by the American expert Larry Kierkegaard. Performers found the original acoustic 'dry'. Existing materials have been reused; wooden panels removed and relined and replaced. Surfaces intended originally to absorb sound have been recast to support it. Boxes now have integrated speakers. The undulating plaster ceiling panels have been faithfully copied and replaced with better materials. There are new, adjustable acoustic wings over the stage. At a private 'acoustic tuning' event I attended last month, however, the master of ceremonies could not be heard in my box - although Brahms was loud and clear.

The Royal Festival Hall is the country's most romantic modern building. It is a place of interesting memories and many layers, not all architectural. It was host to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1960 (Winner: Jacqueline Boyer's 'Tom Pillibi' for France). In 1964 the same Terence Conran who worked on festival stands opened his first Habitat store and popular taste in home furnishing was forever improved. Conran had been inspired by the Days and Race. The year after Habitat, Peter Mandelson learnt of Herbert Morrison's death not from a concerned parent, but in a television newsflash, an event which psychologists might see as the source of a fatal bonding with the media.

It is instructive to consider why we think so fondly of the Royal Festival Hall. First, it recalls an age of innocent optimism, maintained under hardship, when American poet Kenneth Rexroth could write

'How can they write or paintIn a country where itWould be nicer to beFed intravenously'

Rexroth could, perhaps, not have imagined the Babylon of faddish catering now surrounding Martin's egg-in-a-box.

Second, Leslie Martin's successor at the LCC, fellow Mancunian Sir Hubert Bennett (1909-2000), was in the later Fifties and Sixties forced by politically motivated rehousing targets to build tall, using untried construction materials and systems. The result was the nightmare council high rises that so discredited architecture. It was Bennett's team who, in 1971, finished the South Bank Centre, whose wet and windy concrete ramps now make the Royal Festival Hall look 'almost classical' in critic Ian Nairn's words. It is this elegiac quality that makes the Royal Festival Hall great: it is what modernism was meant to be, but politics prevented.

Mandelson's Dome did not, thinking of Disraeli, make the nation forget his government's misdeeds (although it was quietly dropped from its promised place on the first page of the second Blair manifesto). On the contrary, the Dome is a symbol of all that was wrong with Blair: vapid promises, amateurish management, a squeamish refusal to tackle difficult issues and poll-driven sensibilities. We admire the Royal Festival Hall for the imagination, bravery, confidence and vision of the people who built it, free of political interference. In any year, these are the source of great architecture.

Dinah Casson still says of the Royal Festival Hall: 'I love it and visit as often as I can.' Has anyone ever said that of the pathetic Dome?

http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/25/architecture-art,http://web.archive.org/web/20160305122626id_/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/25/architecture-art,Steve Rose on the theatre that's inside-out,1970-08-22 08:05:05.122626,"Less than two years ago, standing in the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern, the outgoing prime minister Tony Blair claimed that the British arts had enjoyed a decade-long ""golden age"". Architecturally, few could deny the landscape has changed remarkably. From London's Tate Modern to Gateshead's Baltic and Sage, from Salford's Lowry to Manchester's Royal Exchange, and with new galleries everywhere from Walsall to West Bromwich, culture-driven architecture has been a trusted route to the holy grail of ""urban regeneration"".

But Blair's parting shot also implied that the golden age was over. Looking at the credit-crunched construction sector and the as-yet unmet 2012 Olympic commitments, it's fair to wonder if the goose has stopped laying. If it has, it has left a clutch of golden eggs in the East Midlands before doing so. In the space of six months, five new arts venues are opening in and around Leicester, Derby and Nottingham - a £90m splurge, largely lottery-funded, that now seems at odds with these frugal times. To build one looks sensible; to build five looks indulgent. After all, how much art does the country need?

But this isn't simply a matter of helicoptering in big boxes of art to blank areas of the cultural map, insists Arts Council England. It's more about the region catching up with its neighbours and learning from their mistakes. ""We weren't exactly saturated with cultural product,"" says Peter Knott, the ACE's East Midlands director. ""But it's not just been about looking over the fence. I think we're on the cusp of something different here.""

Although the venues vary widely, they are intended to complement each other. At one end is Leicester's Curve, a radical £61m theatre; at the other is the £2m Level Centre in rural Derbyshire for people with severe learning disabilities. In between are Nottingham's New Art Exchange, a venue for multi-ethnic visual arts, and Derby's Quad, a funky cinema and exhibition space. All four of these have just opened. Then, ready next spring, there's the Nottingham Contemporary, one of the country's largest and glitziest new art galleries.

The one that most lives up to the promise of ""something different"" is Curve, designed by renowned Uruguayan-American architect Rafael Viñoly. It is one of the most expensive, and therefore riskiest, new buildings on the arts council's books, and its experimental nature pushes the stakes even higher. Here is a building that seeks to turn the long-held traditions of the stage inside-out - literally. It dispenses with the traditional front-of-house/back-of-house arrangement, effectively turning the entire day-to-day operation of the building into one big performance. ""They used these phrases like 'inside-out',"" says Viñoly of his clients, ""but we had to sit down and imagine what that actually means. The question was, how do you make a place that offers a whole new perspective on the magic of theatre?""

Virtually everything is in the open at Curve. The building is essentially one giant volume enclosed under a cloche of louvred glass. There are two auditorium ""islands"", seating 750 and 350 people, that face a common stage area in the middle of the building. Around each island is a loop of foyer space, functioning as public area, backstage, cafe, loading area, whatever. The stage can address either or both auditoria, but it also has no conventional wings - instead there are giant sliding metal shutters at the sides. Actors waiting to enter from the wings are, effectively, standing out in the foyer. When the shutters are raised, stage and foyer become one open figure of eight. Through the uninterrupted strip of glass running around the building at street level, passers-by will be able to see a continual buzz of activity: punters milling about; actors waiting to go on; sets being made; rehearsals in the studios upstairs; even the performance itself. Attending a pre-opening show by the Nofit State Circus, Viñoly was blown away by his design. ""It looked like the building was performing,"" he said.

Curve is the sexy, very 21st-century anchor for the desired regeneration of the city's St George's area, now being refashioned as a cultural quarter. Run-down Victorian garment factories will become a hotbed of creative industries - or so it is hoped. This is in contrast to the commercially driven Highcross part of the city centre, which is distinguished by that other familiar pole of regeneration: a vast new shopping mall, including the smart new John Lewis by Foreign Office Architects. Here are the two ways to put your city on the map: get an art gallery and get a high-end retailer.

It's a similar story in Nottingham. The new Nottingham Contemporary looks set to lend the city the ""destination"" status it craves. It would make any city into a destination. It will be one of the largest contemporary galleries in the country, with four huge exhibition rooms and a performance space, plus the traditional restaurant, cafe and gift shop. Designed by architects Caruso St John, the gallery is decked in glitzy gold-coloured aluminium and grey-green concrete panels embossed with giant lace patterns - the obligatory nod to the industrial heritage it supersedes. Due to the city's split-level topography, it is perched on a cliff edge. Running down its exterior will be steps linking the city centre with the lower level, where a vast Westfield shopping centre is planned.

Derby's Quad is also a building in competition with a colossal new Westfield mall, now drawing visitors away from the city centre - and, boy, does it compete. Designed by Stirling Prize winners Fielden Clegg Bradley, it is all twisty angles, wonky pillars and sloping layers of stone cladding, exactly what you'd expect a contemporary arts centre to look like - fun. What it lacks in gallery space, it makes up for in two plush arthouse cinemas and a cafe.

Is this art versus shopping, or art as shopping? Has culture had to adopt the logic of consumption in order to compete? Build a decent gift shop, and they will come? It all depends on how these buildings are run and what's inside them, but it won't feel like the Midlands equivalent of the Lower East Side if your visitors are just looking for somewhere to put down their TK Maxx bags and have a cappuccino.

There are ways out of this conundrum, and one of them is just a tram ride away from the Nottingham Contemporary. Situated in Hyson Green, the New Art Exchange is well off the beaten track in retail terms, and not nearly as architecturally flash. It is a rather cool black-brick box with a free-form pattern of square openings across its facades. In terms of the actual art - the stuff all this is supposedly about - it has great promise. Dedicated to African, Afro-Caribbean and south Asian arts, the gallery will provide valuable exposure outside London to non-white artists and performers.

Even further from the temptations of commerce is the tiny Level Centre, next door to a tyre repairers in Rowsley. Not strictly a public gallery, it is a home to First Movement, an organisation that develops creativity among people with learning disabilities. Through live video and audio link-ups, groups can interact virtually with others elsewhere in the region. When I visited, a group were gleefully dancing, playing music and using props. Level is the smallest and cheapest of the five new venues, but easily one of the most interesting architecturally: clad in greenish zinc, it merges into the neighbouring Dales, with every aspect carefully considered by architect Peter Clash. The result is a building with an identity all its own.

The delight the Level Centre is bringing to its users underlines the point that art can be made by anyone, out of anything; and that producing it is no less rewarding than consuming it. The East Midlands' initiative has at least factored this in: Viñoly's Curve dissolves barriers between the audience and performers and encourages participation, while Derby's Quad has spaces where local people can come and create anything from paintings to digital animation.

Blair's ""golden age"" may not yet be over. There are more arts buildings to come across Britain, including another Viñoly arts centre in Colchester. But a simple increase in the quantity of arts venues will not revitalise the nation per se. Just look at West Bromwich's The Public. Its opening earlier this year has been marred by an ongoing catalogue of financial woes and technical malfunctions. As a result, the public has stayed away. Risky ventures and straightforward ""art malls"" could find themselves susceptible to the same market forces as their retail counterparts, whose future is not looking rosy.

But if the old adage that the best art comes out of periods of financial difficulty is true, then the East Midlands is now well placed to produce some brilliant new British art. It could be that the golden age has just begun.",East Midlands boom: Why are so many arts centres opening in the area?,119.2,0.7333333333000001,1.0,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Oh, to have been a student at the Bauhaus! Walter Gropius founded his revolutionary school of art and design in 1919: ""Let us create the new building of the future, which will embrace architecture and sculpture and painting in one unity and which will one day rise toward heaven from the hands of a million workers like the crystal symbol of the new faith."" The move of the school from Weimar to Dessau in 1925 gave Gropius the opportunity to make his euphoric manifesto manifest in the form of a futuristic new building that looked like a factory, with its curtain wall of glass and steel. The whole body of teachers and students was involved in the design, construction and finishing of the workshops, lecture rooms and students and staff lodgings. A marvellous party was given at the opening and the word BAUHAUS emblazoned on the building in die neue typographie.

Rietveld Schröder House, Utrecht, Gerrit Rietveld, 1924

Modernism was an adventure in self-discovery. This house was commissioned by Truus Schröder, the radical young widow of a conventional middle-class Dutch lawyer, who wanted a design to express her new-found freedom. Her architect and lover, Gerrit Rietveld, was a member of the avant garde group De Stijl. The Schröder house is an immaculate cubist construction of lines, planes and strong primary colours, rising on its urban site like a three-dimensional version of a painting by Piet Mondrian, another De Stijl member. The first time I saw the Rietveld Schröder House I keeled over and broke an ankle in excitement. It is not a sterile exercise in anti-bourgeois living but a poetic and engaging work of art.

Tuberculosis Sanatorium, Paimio, Alvar Aalto, 1929-33

A rumour has been circulating at the Guardian that I once had a sauna with Alvar Aalto. This is not precisely true. But I did meet Aalto in the 1960s when I first saw his modernist masterwork, the Tuberculosis Sanatorium at Paimio. The building was designed at a time when tuberculosis was still rife and its treatment a matter of maximum exposure to sunlight and bracing Nordic air. The sanatorium was in effect an isolation township but, as Aalto designed it, was anything but gloomy. A great white hope of a building rises high out of the pine woods, reflecting Aalto's humanistic vision that architecture itself could be restorative.

German Pavilion for the Barcelona Exhibition, Mies van der Rohe, 1928-9

Mies van der Rohe's temple of modernity was designed as a temporary exhibition building, representing Germany at Barcelona in 1929. It is my favourite of all modernist buildings, a structure of breathtaking beauty and restraint. The materials are steel, glass, marble and travertine. The pavilion lies low, seeming almost to be floating, discreetly reflected in two oblong pools. The critic Patrick Nuttgens once compared the Barcelona Pavilion to ""a highly sophisticated well-groomed woman at a party"". To me it is actually more of a male presence, coolly intellectual and a little bit sardonic, supreme in its confidence that less is more.

Van Nelle Tobacco Factory, near Rotterdam, Johannes A Brinkmann, Leendert Cornelius van der Vlugt and Mart Stam, 1926-30

A monument to the great age of machine worship, in which the factory became the new cathedral. Never mind that the tobacco factory's prime product appears to be at odds with another of the modernists' obsessions, the cult of healthy bodies. This is a stupendous building, glamorous and fluent, a prize example of the modernists' faith in the potential of the machine for improving human lives. Art and work come together in the precision planning of the factory and its careful human detail, extending to the sybaritic coffee room in the rotunda on the roof.

Woodland Crematorium, Stockholm, Erik Gunnar Asplund and Sigrid Lewerentz, 1935-40

The modernist way with death was like no other. Asplund's Woodland Crematorium on the outer edge of Stockholm is a cubist abstract assemblage of rectangular low buildings. There is that deep green forest in the background. You walk towards the crematorium up a gentle hillside bordered by a low white wall, arriving in a great white polished marble loggia, a rectilinear building of purist dignity. The bodies slide into the cremation ovens through expressionist arches like the entrance to a cavern. A big flight of steps leads the mourners upwards to the ""meditation grove"" set on a grassy knoll. The spirit of the place is both primitive and rational. If I could choose the place of my departing, it would be here.

Penguin Pool, London Zoo, Berthold Lubetkin and Tecton, 1934

Modernist preoccupations did not stop with humans. After designing London Zoo's Gorilla House, the Russian-born architect Berthold Lubetkin turned his attention to the Penguin Pool. This was envisaged as a fun house for the birds, a constructivist delight in reinforced concrete with ingenious interlocking ramps in the centre of the pool, encouraging the birds to form human-seeming queues. The penguins were indulged with ledges, peering holes, pillars and a diving board. The pool was colour-coded in white, blue, grey and zinging scarlet. What more could a bird want? But now the zoo, in its wisdom, has removed the penguins ""for environmental reasons"" and is considering bringing in the porcupines.

De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea, Erich Mendelsohn and Serge Chermayeff 1935-6

Britain has few examples of top-flight modernism. The De La Warr Pavilion is definitely one, designed by the émigré German architect Erich Mendelsohn in partnership with Serge Chermayeff in the politically turbulent decade before the second world war. Their design for a public entertainment centre, a seafront pleasure palace in glass and glinting steel, ran into immediate trouble with the fascists. Who needs foreign architects to defile our English seaside? But the De La Warr Pavilion opened triumphantly in 1936, a hymn to the hedonistic strain in modernism. Beyond their rather daunting manifesto-speak, the modernists believed in having a nice time.

Lawn Road Flats, London, Wells Coates, 1934

The modernist agenda was concerned with improving living conditions over a wide spectrum, resulting in gargantuan schemes for workers' housing such as Karl-Marx-Hof in Vienna. Lawn Road Flats was workers' housing as it percolated down to north-London intellectuals. Pevsner described Wells Coates' reinforced concrete block of flats as ""giant's work of the 1930s"". Agatha Christie, an early resident, compared it to an ocean liner. This is a building I adore not just for its architectural probity but also for its promise of new liberated living. Minimal flats were kitchenless and child-free. Meals and laundry were provided centrally. A modernist utopia, now a forgotten dream.

E-1027, Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, Eileen Gray and Jean Badovici, 1926-9

This was not quite the first of the white houses set on stilts but I have always thought it the most beautiful and moving. How Eileen Gray would have hated the phrase ""a woman's touch"" - but there surely is a female sensibility in the wit and practicality of the planning of this building on the rocks above the Mediterranean sea. There is a quality of improvisation, a holiday spirit, in E-1027, the house built for her then lover, Jean Badovici, the Romanian architectural critic. Gray designed all the furniture and fittings, which included the now iconic Transat and Bibendum chairs. The house shows modernism at its least dogmatic, perfectly attuned to its wild, natural surroundings. Gray herself regarded it as ""a living organism"".","Whether you were a worker who wanted a home, a student looking for a classroom or a penguin in need of a dip, the modernists had just the place for you.

Jubilee Wharf in Penryn, Cornwall. Photographs: Christine Sullivan

The old Cornish port of Penryn, straddling two creeks and lined with streets that rise and fall like breakers, was once at the heart of the local granite trade. Ships would set sail from here laden with stone for great building projects around the world, from Singapore to Buenos Aires and beyond.

Penryn never boasted architecture to match these far-flung, grandiose cities, although it has a vernacular charm and touches of Georgian virtuosity. Now, though, it could become a magnet for anyone and everyone - architects, builders, developers, politicians and perhaps the Duke of Cornwall himself - interested in genuine low-energy design. In fact, the brand new Jubilee Wharf, a creek-side development comprising flats for local people to rent, 12 craft workshops, a public hall, a nursery and shops, might well be the greenest British building to date. Its carbon emissions seem to be a happy zero. It has been built as far as possible from local materials, including red cedar and larch, using local labour. And it fits, in an appropriately ramshackle way, into the higgledy-piggledy fabric of Penryn.

From a strictly aesthetic point of view, this cluster of buildings seems curious and even questionable at first. Planners were originally unsure, but saw the light and wisely approved the design. It grew on me quickly, for two reasons. First, this is obviously a very thoughtful project, its look based, although not slavishly, on the happy mess of old nautical buildings beside it. There are boats moored alongside, a few of them gleaming, but mostly battered old sea creatures seemingly held together by thick layers of muddy paint; somehow, it all fits together.

Secondly, although new, it is already a welcoming place. The two blocks of the development - one four storeys high, comprising studio workshops with maisonettes above; the other over two storeys, housing a nursery, public hall and cafe - enclose a courtyard, protected from the occasionally fierce coastal wind.

People have already moved into the maisonettes, including Andrew Marston, whose development company Robotmother dreamed up Jubilee Wharf, and his wife Alice, who runs the cafe. Marston's master touch was to commission ZEDfactory (formerly Bill Dunster architects), established in 1998 with a mission to produce intelligent, low-energy buildings; ZED stands for zero energy development. Bill Dunster has long practiced what he preaches. His family home, Hope House in Surrey, is an experiment in green design, while the BedZED flats he designed for the Peabody Trust at Beddington, Surrey, are, despite teething troubles, an important step towards truly sustainable homes.

Dunster would like houses to be responsible for their own energy demands. At Jubilee Wharf, four 6kw wind turbines and one 75kw wood-pellet biomass boiler (burning cleanly and efficiently what is effectively compacted rubbish) provide pretty much all the power needed for the development. Solar cells will be added to provide essentially free electricity throughout Penryn's riviera-like summer, while all parts of the building are highly insulated. The turbines seem quiet when compared with those giants whining on fields and downs around the country, and complement the array of masts rising from boats along the Penryn wharves.

The maisonettes are a delight. Warm and cosy, each boasts what would once have been called a ""sun lounge"", an enclosed suntrap that retains whatever heat comes in through the living room windows looking out over the estuary. Wind cowls on the maisonette roofs provide ventilation when windows are shut, ushering in fresh air with the prevailing wind. Similar cowls on the roofs of flats at BedZED have seized up over time; the solution here has been wheel hub bearings from Ford Mondeos, designed to spin around for a quarter of a million miles or more.

The flats also face into the courtyard, already quietly bustling. A craft fair and a farmers' market are in the offing, while a bike shop has opened, and the cafe, with its warm recycled timber interior, is buzzing. The big public hall has a timber roof shaped like the upturned hull of a boat, and is clad in cheap, hard-wearing zinc. The curved roof is not just there for show; it's a means of sweeping, or deflecting, sea winds up and over both the courtyard and the block of studio workshops and maisonettes.

With so much experimental ingenuity at work, it might be assumed that the cost of Jubilee Wharf has been on the high side. Not so: Andrew Marston's development has cost £3.6m. Of this, £470,000 was raised by Carrick district council through Objective One, an EU fund aimed at developing areas where prosperity is 25% below the EU average. A further £350,000 was provided for the 30-place nursery by SureStart, the government childcare programme. And the cost would have been at least half a million pounds less if the ground beneath the derelict sheds that stood on the site hadn't been laced with forgotten sewers, and other pitfalls.

Jubilee Wharf should prove exceptionally cheap to run. More than this, Andrew Marston and Bill Dunster have shown an intelligent way for small towns to develop, economically and socially. Too many councils give in to the bullying demands of supermarket chains, as if these unsustainable land monsters were the only means of boosting employment and local income. How about a few, or more than a few, variations on the theme of Jubilee Wharf, reflecting the topography, style, local production, sentiments and ambitions of people in different parts of the country? Let's hope for more developments with the intelligence - if not always the creekside look - of Jubilee Wharf.",Is this the greenest place to live in Britain?

The family real estate trust that owns the company’s Burlington property is selling it to an unnamed buyer for an undisclosed price, according to trustee Bill Elovitz, who runs The Rug Department. Elovitz is the son of Gerry Elovitz, better known as Jerry Ellis. The elder Elovitz operated Building 19 — known for its “good stuff cheap” and ramshackle stores — from the 1960s until last year, when the chain filed for bankruptcy protection.

“I knew when we opened both stores that at some point we would have to do something with some of the valuable real estate we own,” Bill Elovitz said. The 10 Building 19 properties were placed in real estate trusts by the Elovitzes to insulate them from vendors and others who are owed money.

“We have a very interested buyer for the Burlington property, so we decided to sell it off,” said Elovitz. He would not name the buyer or say what it plans to do with the property, and did not give a date for the Burlington store’s closing.

The Rug Department stocks handmade rugs from China and India as well as machine-made rugs from the United States and Belgium. The store also carries old Persian rugs, some of them priced as high as $25,000. Elovitz used to travel the world looking for rugs to buy. But he gave that up long ago and now buys them from what he calls his “New York City connections.”

“I would have loved to have kept the store open, but life is full of difficult decisions,” Elovitz said. While the Norwood store will remain in business, he said he has no plans to open any new locations.","After just eight months in business, The Rug Department --  a spinoff of the bankrupt Building 19 discount retailer --  is shutting down one of its two stores.",11.0625,0.875,8.1875,low,medium,mixed,architecture

MassDevelopment, not the Boston Redevelopment Authority, will own the two older brick buildings in Fort Point that will be part of the new headquarters complex for General Electric Co.

GE had originally planned to work directly with the BRA to redevelop two six-story vacant buildings on Necco Court in Boston’s Fort Point section. Those buildings would need to be owned by a public agency in order to receive funds from a state grant program that was part of the incentive package Massachusetts officials offered GE to move here. The company would own a new larger structure next door that it plans to build.

While it was originally thought the BRA would eventually own the two older buildings, state and city officials Thursday said MassDevelopment would become the landlord instead and lease them to GE. The main reason: streamlining bureaucracy.

Jay Ash, the state’s secretary of housing and economic development, oversees the state grant program that would subsidize the property, and also chairs the board of MassDevelopment. Because state funds are involved, Ash said it would be easier for MassDevelopment to handle the logistics of getting the buildings ready for GE.

State officials are still negotiating their incentive package with GE, Ash said, but he expects the eventual size to be between $80 million and $120 million. The money, among other things, would be used to acquire the two dilapidated Necco buildings and help improve the properties. The city of Boston has also offered up to $25 million in property tax breaks to the company.

To develop its new headquarters, GE plans to buy an approximately 2.5-acre section of the northern end of Gillette’s Fort Point campus. GE would keep the portion where the new building would go up, while MassDevelopment would immediately buy the two Necco buildings and an area that would be devoted to open space, including a waterfront park. Those transfers are expected to take place later this summer or in the fall.

The goal: to have a new headquarters open in 2018 at the site. In the meantime, GE has chosen temporary digs on nearby Farnsworth Street and expects to move as many as 200 people there in August, primarily from GE’s current headquarters in Fairfield, Conn. Eventually, as many as 800 people are expected to work in the new headquarters in Boston.

GE officials say the three-building complex in Fort Point would total about 300,000 square feet. The company has hired architectural firm Gensler to design the new headquarters, although it has not yet picked a general contractor to oversee the construction.

John Barros, Boston’s economic development chief, said the decision to move the Necco buildings’ ownership to MassDevelopment instead of the BRA was a mutual one. “Because the state is supplying the money on this, having a state agency do this makes a lot of sense,” Barros said.

GE spokeswoman Susan Bishop issued a statement saying the company also supported the move.

“The City and State came to us with an alternative approach to the ownership structure that all parties agree will be more streamlined and efficient,” Bishop said. “This is a complicated transaction and we are pleased that everyone is working to find the best approach.”",State and city officials Thursday said MassDevelopment would become the landlord and lease part of the headquarters complex to GE.,29.1904761905,1.0,7.0,medium,high,mixed,architecture

An architect might help,1970-08-22 02:33:45.084653,"Q. A question that people often grapple with if their house isn’t suiting them, for various reasons, is: “Should we stay and renovate or look for a new house”?

A. People often think that the perfect house for them exists somewhere out there, but more often than not when you buy a house, you still need to do something to make it your own or just to bring it up to date.

If you have been looking around to buy a house and have seen houses that aren’t quite right or one that seems to have the potential to become the house you want and is in the location that you want, it may be a good idea to have an architect do a walk-through with you to get a professional assessment before you take the big step. As everyone knows, there are many factors to consider when buying a house. An architect can help answer these questions:

1. Are there physical constraints to the house/site?

2. Are there zoning parameters that may play a role in your decision? An architect familiar with the city or town that the house is in can be a valuable resource.

3. An architect can also create a vision of what the house can be, often with minimal design moves.

You can ask people you know or your real estate agent about architects who do work in the area you are looking in and who might be willing to do a consultation, sometimes for a fee, and assess your house along with your needs and diagnose the issues and present possible solutions. Armed with feedback from an architect, you can make a much more confident offer. Then, after the deal is done, that’s when you and the architect can get to work creating the home you want.

Here is an example. As the architect on the 2010 “This Old House,” I was able to help my clients make the decision to buy that particular house. It was in a wonderful neighborhood for their children and was on the Charles River.

The house, while in decent shape, was a very modest, dated Colonial sorely in need of some architectural intervention. The site was phenomenal and yet the house did not capitalize on the views and light. As I told my clients, the site and location are excellent while the house isn’t. But the house can be changed. The location cannot.","Q. A question that people often grapple with if their house isn’t suiting them, for various reasons, is: “Should we stay and renovate or look for a new house”?  A.

http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/nov/21/architecture.communities,http://web.archive.org/web/20140920035054id_/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/nov/21/architecture.communities,Architect Renzo Piano tells Emma Brockes why cities have been betrayed,1970-08-22 02:42:00.035054,"He is, by reputation, among the world's greatest architects, but ""Ach"", says Renzo Piano, slapping a green ceramic tile on his work bench, ""I am the son of a builder. This is what it comes down to."" We are in his Paris office, a predictably beautiful loft-type space full of wooden surfaces and metal walkways and floppy-haired junior architects, to whom Piano speaks in a variety of languages. He can theorise about space with the best of them, but really, he asks, must architecture always be so pretentious? To those who draw analogies between it and sculpture he spits ""Bullshit! Bullshit!"" and clings to the bench as if earthing himself.

The Renzo Piano Building Workshop is not the largest firm of architects in the world, but its commissions are among the most prestigious. Since he made his name, aged 33, by codesigning the Pompidou Centre in Paris with Richard Rogers, Piano has laboured to combine his skills as an architect with his political and sociological theories. He abhors the word ""style"", which he calls a form of narcissism, and declines to find any consistent theme in his work. The only thing that links the Paul Klee museum in Bern, the Kansai International airport terminal in Osaka and the reconstruction of Potsdamer Platz in Berlin is Piano's belief that architecture has a duty ""to suggest behaviour"". In the light of the Paris riots, he says, cities have been failed by architects as much as by politicians.

Piano is 68 now, thin, and with a quivering energy. His expression is one of mild amusement. Where other architects pitch for a job with PowerPoint presentations and whizzy models, Piano will turn up with a pad of paper and a green felt-tip pen. Nevertheless, his methods have recently won him commissions for the new New York Times skyscraper, the extension to Columbia University in Harlem and the London Bridge Tower, the so-called ""Shard of Glass"", due for completion in 2010. Through the London Bridge development, Piano wants to introduce the European idea of urban planning to the British capital, ideas which he characterises as understanding the difference between a piazza (good) and a plaza (less good).

""A piazza is not a plaza,"" fumes Piano. ""The plaza is the theme park of the piazza; the plaza is the commercial version. A piazza is an empty space with no function. This is what Europeans understand."" A space without function allows one to be ""in the moment"", he says, and to counter what he sees as a major flaw in modern life - the habit of interpreting all experience in the light of achievement, as a means to an end. We should, he thinks, learn to lighten up, and the creation of empty, purposeless spaces within cities might encourage that. ""You don't have to struggle to give function to every single corner. You can just wait and see and enjoy.""

Americans don't really get this either. That is why when he attended the opening of his extension to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta three weeks ago, Piano took aside Shirley Franklin, the mayor - ""a great lady"" - and implored her to keep the piazza outside the museum uncluttered. The day after the launch, however, some commercial detritus was left there and Piano, an otherwise mild man, says he exploded. ""Why? Why? This is a piazza not a plaza! Empty! Empty!"" After his outburst the municipal authorities assured him that every morning the place would be ""clear for invasion"".

The talk of not struggling is all very well, but in order to be where he is today, Piano has had to work very hard, with great purpose and commercial nous. (His point is that it is a question of balance.) Piano's outlook is heavily influenced by two things: having been a child in postwar Italy, and growing up near a port. ""A harbour,"" he says, ""is like an imaginary city where everything keeps moving.""

Every Sunday his father would take him to Genoa's harbour and Piano would watch the ships, which he thought of as ""immense buildings that move"". When they sailed, he watched them cross the water and imagined that they were flying. These notions converged in his mind to form an idea of buildings as structures that ""fought against gravity"", as ""miracles"".

What he calls his ""obsession with lightness"" - lightness as both a physical and an emotional property - comes from these experiences. Piano describes Genoa as ""the austere version of Venice - Venice is the city of extroversion and Genoa the city of introversion"" - and says he carries the memory of it in his ""skin"".

He has spoken a lot about his father, the builder, from whom he learned the value of good craftsmanship. When the family went on holiday, they would take a detour to look at a marble quarry: ""I don't remember a single thing in my childhood that was not related in some way to building."" His father took him on building sites as a child and set him small tasks. ""He was not an incredible builder. He didn't build the Eiffel Tower. He was making houses. But if, as an eight-year-old boy, you work on site in the morning and the next morning, you realise the column you have built is getting higher - this idea that you can, with your little hands, manipulate things - this is a miracle. Always a miracle.""

He has rarely mentioned his mother; I ask what he learned from her and Piano pauses before answering. ""I guess a stubbornness. She was the most stubborn person in the world. She'd never accept that I was bad. And I was bad. At school I was bad. But she never accepted that. Also my mother got the . . . It's a very sad story."" He pauses.

""I had a brother who died before I was born. One year before. In '36. And the name of this brother was Renzo. So - probably I've never told this story, but it's true - I took the place of another son. I have the same name. I was myself born because of a stubborn, resistant approach to fate; and to tragedy. He died when he was 13 years old from a stupid accident, because penicillin was not available. He was a young boy, in fantastic health. So, my mother was that kind of person. Testardaggine; 'entêtement' en Français; stubborn. She never gave up. She always thought that I would get to be good."" He smiles. ""And I got to be good.""

Piano likes to think he has attained this same quality of stubbornness in adulthood. But because is is essentially ""sublime"", he says, he is often wrongly identified as lacking confidence. Professionally speaking, he says, the people who make the most noise often have the least to shout about. ""In some way, people believe that if you are permeable, if you are a good listener, you don't have the quality of somebody with a firm attitude. But this is not true. I think people should try to teach young children that these qualities - stubbornness and a capacity to listen- might look like they are opposites, but they are not. This is what, fundamentally, I got from my mother."" He is teaching the same lesson to his young son, Giorgio, whom he had relatively late in life with his second wife, Milly, also an architect. He has two adult sons from his first marriage.

Piano's other great linchpin is his optimism, which he relates to the experience of growing up during the postwar reconstruction, particularly since his father was so intimately involved in it. This was not architecture as decoration, or art, but as a solid, practical, desperately needed provision for Italy's poorest families. ""I learned that, day by day, you make a better street, a better road, a better walkway, better houses, better something."" Of course, he says, memories of the war fade, ""but your chromosomes remember"". He believes in progress; the idea that ""time gives humanity the possibility to run away from tragedy. That makes a lot of sense."" And so the foundations upon which he built his career were laid.

He is not romantic about human nature, however. When he talks about progress, he is careful to separate technological advance from, say, ""ethics"", which he says, smiling wryly, show no signs of improving. He was not surprised by the riots in the suburbs of Paris and he relates them to a misconception politicians have about the function of cities and their peripheries, which he believes have been vilely neglected by the planning authorities.

After Paris, what can be done to improve the suburbs? This, he says, is the key question. ""The big topic of today, and of the next 20 years, will be peripheries. How you can transform peripheries into a town. What is happening today in Paris is happening everywhere. It is mad, mad, and the insensitivity of people and politicians . . . They create ghettos. In Paris it is particularly bad. Now people are starting to understand that the real challenge of the next 30 years is to turn peripheries into cities. The peripheries are the cities that will be. Or not. Or will never be.""

Has he visited the sites of the riots?

""I go all the time. Not this week, but I know them well. It's a tragedy but you have to understand that France is a place with a very heavy heritage from Algeria and North Africa."" It is partly the fault of the French state that this heritage, which Piano regards as a rich and valuable thing, has been so badly mangled. The mistake, he says, has been a conceptual one. France's politicians have failed to understand that for a community to work, it cannot be a ""ghetto""; it must be a place in which people work, and sleep, and socialise and, most importantly, ""merge"" in some way.

He says ghettoes are ""against the idea of a city. Cities are a place of tolerance, by definition, where difference must merge. It's tragically predictable, what happened, and it will probably happen again if something isn't done. It is also because of the government; these people don't understand the important of tolerance."" He is not naive enough to believe that his field of endeavour can fix this. But does he believe that architecture can help build that tolerance? ""Architecture in some way has the duty to suggest behaviour. In some way. Places are the portrait of communities, and if the place is impossible, the community becomes impossible.""

And so Piano applies to his work this idea of encouraging people to mingle, as he did when he and Rogers created the piazza outside the Pompidou Centre all those years ago. If he has his way, there will be a similar open space outside London's Shard of Glass. He is passionate about this, but at the same time, he says he gets a little nervous when he is treated with too much reverence by his clients. Even now, he says, he is a ""bit surprised"" that people trust him with multi-million-dollar projects. It's a problem, the reverence, because ""sometimes people believe what you say so much that you are left without a defence"".

""If you grow up in a school where you are not the first in class, then you grow up with the feeling that you can learn from other people. If you are the first in the class, I guess - I never experienced that - but I guess you grow up with the feeling that other people will learn from you. You are teaching others, not the opposite. And I feel that there is a moment when, unfortunately, because of that, you stop learning. You stop absorbing. And life is about learning, about grabbing every occasion. And art is about that; art is robbery in the noblest sense. It is taking things. Art! Art! In every sense."" And architecture, too? ""Yes. Architecture is about robbery.

We've learned not to mention our address, because it makes people assume we're super wealthy. In fact we were just lucky; about four years ago we were looking for a new place when a good friend of ours was looking for new tenants to look after her flat here.

It's definitely a place built for show: there are always tourists outside taking photos, and in the evenings you can sometimes hear a horse and a carriage driving past outside.

Regency architecture is decorative and ostentatious, which can be both a blessing and a burden. All the buildings on the Circus are Grade-I-listed, so on the outside they haven't been altered much since they were built in the mid-18th century. You aren't allowed satellite dishes or anything like that. The stairs down into the basement have been blocked off, but the original fireplaces and ceiling mouldings are still intact. In our lounge we have the original huge sliding doors. The ceilings are their original height.

These buildings make very good, quiet flats, because they were so well built, out of solid, thick stone. All the bedrooms are at the back of the house, overlooking the gardens. You never hear your neighbours – and I think that's something that has been lost in modern buildings. Even though it's a flat, it feels more like a house.

We're both from South Africa, where things are a lot more spacious than in Britain – inside and out. When you first come to England everything feels so tiny, you almost feel claustrophobic. So these huge rooms brought back that familiar sense of space. The flipside, of course, is being South Africans, we like the heat, so our gas bills tend to be high.

We recently heard that Jane Austen used to take tea with friends in our house. It didn't faze us much, but when my parents heard they went crazy.

Living here has taught us to appreciate this kind of historic building in a new way. As South Africans, we don't really live for the past, but living here has taught us to look at the past in a new way.",Life in a Georgian home,86.0,0.4,0.8,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Forgotten Empire, the British Museum calls its spectacular resurrection of ancient Persia. Yet the Persians are as notorious in their way as Darth Vader, the Sheriff of Nottingham, General Custer, or any other embodiment of evil empire you care to mention. They are history's original villains.

In its day, which lasted from the middle of the 500s BC until the defeat of Darius III by Alexander the Great in 331 BC, the Persian empire ruled a vast portion of the then-known world from the Nile to the Indus. It connected the Mediterranean with modern Afghanistan. Rich beyond dreams, powerful beyond dispute, the great kings ruled from their mighty palaces at Susa and Persepolis, tolerating the religions and cultures of subject peoples and harvesting the creativity of near eastern civilisation that had already, before they came along, invented writing and urban life. It should have been enough to earn them historical immortality.

Yet, of course, the leader whose name resonates down the ages is Alexander the Great. The Persian kings, from their lofty thrones, perceived the turbulent islands on the western fringe of the empire as a marginal irritant, and yet the Greeks were their nemesis. For the Persians had the misfortune to be the others, the enemies - in short, the Orientals - against whom the first European civilisation defined itself.

The Middle East invented writing, but ancient Greece invented history. Herodotus, ""the father of history"", takes as his epic theme the struggle of the Greek city states against the vast Persian empire - and sees it as a war of liberation. The idea of democracy was born in the fight against Persian despotism: that is how Herodotus tells it. The Persian king Xerxes is the supreme overlord of all baddies, turning his eye on the plucky little Greek cities who, unexpectedly, fight back. Now you remember the Persians: the guys with the strange beards whom the Athenians beat at Marathon. Until Marathon, says Herodotus, ""no Greek could even hear the word Persian without terror"". In finding the courage to fight Persia, the Greeks discovered their own identity as citizens.

All western political theory is implicitly defined against the ghost of Persia - from condemnations of ""tyrants"" in the Atlantic republican tradition to Marx's caricature of ""oriental despotism"". In winning their nationhood, the Greeks consigned the Persians to a miserable place in the world's memory.

The most vivid portrait of a Persian ruler isn't even in this exhibition. It appears in a mosaic found in Pompeii, now in the Naples Archaeological Museum, based on a lost painting of Alexander the Great in battle. Through a tangle of horses, men and spears, Alexander charges. Darius stands helpless in his chariot, his face startled and appalled, like a frightened rabbit. So much for Persia!

This is how history is made - by writers and artists recycling stories and images down the centuries. This mosaic decorated the House of the Faun in Pompeii centuries after the fall of Darius; millennia after that, the victories of Alexander are still box office.

It takes Neil MacGregor's idealistic British Museum to put the Persian point of view. Everything about Forgotten Empire is calculated to turn history on its head. This is archaeology meeting world politics. The very existence of the exhibition is a diplomatic coup: in case you hadn't noticed, Persia is now Iran. The loans from Tehran that have made Forgotten Empire possible were negotiated before the recent change of government and had to be renegotiated at the last minute.

This is the kind of exhibition I expect of the British Museum. Here at last is the enlightening encounter with another culture that, in the Bloomsbury museum's years of decline, was replaced by crap like an Agatha Christie show. At the same time, it's laudably different from a Royal Academy blockbuster: less swank, more thought. I can promise you will not only be delighted by gold daggers and chariots but leave with a sense of Persian history. It's first rate.

So why was I disappointed? I was left flat - not by the superb show but by the Persian empire itself. The British Museum wants us to believe Persia was traduced by the Greeks. It wants to show us an alternative Persia from the evil empire vilified by Hellenic historians. Yet everything confirms this Greek ""myth"" of a supremely rich, powerful, bureaucratically faceless empire. The real difference between the Greek version and the version we get here is that the Greeks made the Persians glamorous in their villainy.

The Persian kings, their wives, ministers, soldiers and myriad subjects are a void at the heart of this exhibition. They don't emerge, in their own art, as individuals, only as warriors in profile, with the same neat beards. In Herodotus, the Persian ruler Darius, when he was told of Athenian support for rebels in Asia Minor, called for his bow, took an arrow, shot it into the air and cried: ""Grant, O God, that I might punish the Athenians!"" Compare that with the real voice of a Persian king, on a clay tablet telling of the construction of the palace at Susa: ""Saith Darius the King: Ahuramazda, the greatest of the gods - he created me; he made me king; he bestowed upon me this kingdom, great, possessed of good horses, possessed of good men ..."" The Greek fantasy of a monarch convulsed with anger, demanding his bow, is so much more dramatic, more human.

The same contrast between Greeks and Persians is unavoidable when you contemplate the most imposing monuments here. Unfortunately, they appear in a 19th-century collection of plastercasts; the reliefs that survive on the ruins of the palace at Persepolis are inaccessible, unless you fancy a trip to Iran. I find it hard to enjoy reproductions. Nevertheless, some judgments are possible. The celebrated frieze of various peoples paying tribute is imposing. But the figures have a static quality. No one runs, nothing overlaps. Even the wonderful carving of two immense lions, or the black stone mastiff from Tehran - an original - succeed through mass rather than movement.

If you wanted to claim, as a newspaper did this week, that Persia was ""the greatest of all ancient civilisations"" you'd be better off picking a venue other than the British Museum. Just a walk from the show are the Elgin Marbles - the frieze of the Parthenon created after the Athenian acropolis was razed by the Persians. The Greek masterpiece is full of motion and emotion, from horses barely reined in, to a heifer being led to sacrifice.

Where's the passion in Persian art? Its very beauty - and it is beautiful - lies in its strange stillness; you see this most in the painted brick profiles of palace guards. Yet this praise has to be qualified. This kind of glazed brick decoration isn't original to the Persian empire; they got it from Babylon - to be precise, from the neo-Babylonian kingdom that they subdued. This isn't about east versus west. With our idiocy being what it is, the British Museum runs a risk of confusing us into equating Persia with the near-eastern origins of civilisation. The Persian empire followed, and conquered, the Assyrians and neo-Babylonians - and was about two millennia after Ur. All these cultures were greater than Persia's, as a quick tour of the British Museum will indicate.

The Persian empire was admirably curious about the cultures it absorbed: in Egypt the Persian kings paid homage to Egyptian gods. It assimilated the cultural heritage of the entire eastern Mediterranean world, including that of Greece; a wonderful silver and bronze amphora handle in the shape of an ibex rests on a mask of a Greek satyr. But all this openness has an emptiness at its heart. No one is even quite sure what the Persians believed - how strange, in an ancient world so full of gods, from Osiris to Zeus to Jehovah, that only a single case is filled with religious offerings. Were they just boring bureaucrats?

Yet we do get a glimpse of what they loved. They liked to live it up. The most startling things here are gold and silver drinking vessels in the shape of horns - just a taste of the opulent lifestyle of the Persian court. That, too, becomes a little offputting as you admire one gold bracelet too many.

It sounds as if I'm kicking against this exhibition. I suppose I am, yet it is archaeology at its most impressive. You might even say it is archaeology versus history. The Greeks wrote history. The Persians are recovered here through archaeology - the study of objects retrieved from the sand. Yet history wins. The Persian empire visible in its surviving artefacts turns out to be as grandiose, luxurious and remotely despotic as Herodotus said it was.

There is a Toby Keith song with the lyrics, “I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then.” With each catastrophic disaster, I am reminded of this song. I was an emergency responder following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and continue to work towards the Gulf’s recovery. It is predicted that the books will not be closed on that storm until 2026. Back then, I had no idea how long the road to recovery would be. I often wish I didn’t know now relief is just the beginning and taking the long view is much harder. We must implement the lessons we learned that allow us to take the longer – and sometimes harder – view. So let us try a new approach with Typhoon Haiyan, and implement these lessons of recovery, rebuilding, and preparation.

Relief organizations are already mobilized and on the ground in the Philippines doing initial assessments and providing life-saving supplies and medical care. The Washington, DC-based alliance organization InterAction reports that there are areas where 80-90% of homes have been destroyed, so it is crucial to find inhabitants shelter. They are also working to clear lines of communication, restore electricity, and clear roads to allow relief aid to get to the most isolated regions. Hold tight, eager volunteers: USAID, InterAction, NetHope, and other relief entities have perfected coordinating immediate relief and emergency aid. The role of such organizations is to get into a region, save the inhabitants from immediate trauma and death, and then leave.

Once relief efforts leave, the long, winding road to recovery begins. Six to eight weeks following a disaster, when media attention has waned, there is a decrease in giving as well. However, while media, funders, and emergency responders spend a short amount of time dealing with immediate needs, this does not create the infrastructure to mitigate future risk, and leaves long-term needs such as resettlement, mental and public health, as well as fiscal viability unfunded and unattended. Grass-roots humanitarian organizations that provide year-round support to sustain local communities’ on-going needs and enable them to recover do exist. However, to sustain year-round recovery and capacity-building, these organizations require year-round funding.

The faster communities recover, the better they do in the face of compounding disasters. Less than a month ago, the Philippines experienced a 7.2 magnitude earthquake. People in Bohol and other provinces were still living under tarpaulins and in makeshift housing, leaving them particularly vulnerable to the typhoon. Those whose houses were damaged by the earthquake were made unlivable by the typhoon. The Philippines has faced devastating storms three years in a row, and they are located in the aptly named Pacific “Ring of Fire,” named for its prevalence of volcanoes and earthquakes. It is home to over 75 percent of the Earth’s active and dormant volcanoes and roughly 81 percent of the largest earthquakes occur in this region, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. They see an average of 19 typhoons each year: it is almost inevitable that they will again face compound disasters.

In the U.S., the Gulf region has used the crises of flooding and coastal erosion as an economic driver, in the form of coastal restoration. There is an emerging “business of resilience.” Can the Philippines turn increasing coastal resilience into an industry? The GDP of the Philippines has been rising every year since 1998, and in 2011 the International Monetary Fund reported that the Philippines boasted the 45th-largest economy in the world. In order to continue this upward economic trajectory, the Philippines must continue to build stronger communities. This recovery process affords the possibility of building back stronger and improving infrastructure so that communities are better prepared in the face of future catastrophes. This includes more viable evacuation and resettlement planning.

Investing in solid, long-term rebuilding can also empower communities to take control of their own recovery. FEMA employs this “Survivor-Centric Response” in the U.S. In taking an active role in their own recovery, they report that a community is able to build local capacity. It also enables those taking part to feel better psychologically and, in knowing that they have the ability to rebuild their own lives, they also feel more positive about their ability to cope with future disasters.

In giving to emergency relief, every dollar counts. In terms of long-term recovery of the Philippines, it takes an investment of not only cash, but time, endurance, empathy, and your sturdiest pair of running shoes to complete the marathon. Evidence from the U.S. Geological Survey and the World Bank indicate that for every dollar invested in disaster risk reduction, between $2 and $10 is saved in disaster response and recovery costs. Meanwhile, the return on the investment in humanity is priceless!

http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/nov/23/architecture.travelnews,http://web.archive.org/web/20140926024717id_/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/nov/23/architecture.travelnews,The restoration of Dresden train station,1970-08-22 02:42:06.024717,"The gleaming new pair of sandstone clock towers sitting on top of Dresden's central station are remarkable for several reasons. Primarily, there's the fact that they're back in something close to their original form for the first time since the city was devastated by Allied bombing in 1945. But there's also the fact that they've been rebuilt by the last architect you would associate with historical stonework in Germany - Norman Foster. Britain's global ambassador of steel and glass and all things cutting-edge is unlikely to branch much further into the field of 19th-century imitation that this, but these clock towers were a special case. Foster's team haven't just restored Dresden station, they've transformed it, and arguably improved on the original.

The clock towers are by no means the highlight of the building. It's what Foster and Partners have done with the main train shed that really takes the breath away. Rather than a conventional solid roof, a translucent skin of Teflon-coated glass fibre has been stretched over the original steel arches spanning the platforms, and the effect is striking. Arriving at the station by rail, with the winter sun low in the sky, natural light floods into the vast, curvaceous space, and every element of the three-arched structure is thrown into sharp relief; even if you had no interest in trains or architecture, you'd have to confess it's a thing of beauty, like pulling into an enormous Zeppelin.

The station was built in the 1890s, but it is difficult to believe it could be so old. You could hardly make it lighter if you were designing it today. ""Every time I see it, I'm surprised at how much the colour changes as the sun works its way around the station,"" says Stanley Fuls, Foster and Partners' project architect. ""Before, you could look up and not be able to see the roof because it was so dark. The roof they put in after the war was timber with only small plastic skylights, and the plastic had become really dull with all the diesel fumes and everything.""

Now the structure's graceful curves are as clear as a diagram. There are practical benefits to Foster's roof, too. For most of the day, the station requires virtually no additional lighting, which means less architectural clutter and lower energy consumption. At night, the inside of the membrane reflects and diffuses the artificial light, creating an even wash; from the outside, it glows like a lantern. The skin is also low-maintenance: the Teflon coating, as you'd imagine, repels grime as a non-stick frying pan would. A host of other technological tricks have been deployed to make this roof work, from cable systems to cope with the build-up of snow, down to specially designed wires to keep the pigeons off (conventional spikes could damage the membrane) - but it all takes a back seat. For an architect commonly associated with conspicuous, attention-grabbing projects like skyscrapers and airports, this is Foster showing his sensitive side.

The same spirit of humility has been extended to the main station building, where the process has been one of subtraction as much as addition. In contrast to the lightweight structure of the train shed, the station itself is a monumental stone structure, whose generous arcades resemble the cruciform vaults of a cathedral. The building survived the horrific bombings of February 1945 largely intact, only to be vandalised by the East German authorities soon afterwards. But as the architects removed decades' worth of clumsy alterations, forgotten features of the station emerged. Squared-off windows throughout the station were revealed to be taller, arched ones. At the train-shed end of the station building, the original rusticated stonework and cast-iron supports for a balcony were miraculously well preserved beneath crude plaster and advertising hoardings. Two halls either side of the central corridor (originally upper and lower class waiting rooms) have been stripped back to their scarred decorative brickwork, and roofed over with unobtrusive steel and glass to create warmer, more intimate spaces.

The most conspicuous addition is a new glass cupola that rises above the front entrance, over the intersection of the two arcades. It could be taken as a reference to Foster's famous addition to the Reichstag, the new German Parliament building in Berlin, but again, it is simply a feature of the original design that has been brought back - albeit with a hi-tech twist: hovering beneath its dome is a movable transparent foil cushion. In winter it seals the heat in, but in summer it rises up half a metre, allowing warm air to flow up and out of the cupola's louvres, so the building naturally ventilates itself.

The net effect of Foster's interventions is a calm, almost monastic simplicity. The plain, pale surfaces, the minimal detailing, and the extensive use of glass all serve to create a clean, open space where before there was a dark, grimy one. The only thing spoiling it is the decor of the commercial concessions inside. ""What's really great about the station is views and light,"" says Fuls, ""and this is not our achievement, this is in the original design. If you're standing on the platforms you can see right down into the hall, or across to the other platforms. Or you can be down in Burger King and still see your train arriving up here.""

The station opened earlier this month, and many Dresden residents have turned up to see it, even if they don't plan to use it yet. At any time of day, there seem to be elderly visitors standing on the new glass balcony, looking out over the platforms and their new roof. It is unlikely that they are thinking purely about the construction. Dresden will never be an ordinary city, and this station has had an extraordinary history.

During the second world war, it served as a military supply point, and saw the transit of trains full of prisoners heading for the concentration camps. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, trains carrying refugees from Czechoslovakia passed through the station en route to West Germany. Crowds watched from the platforms, then took to the streets outside to demand similar freedoms. In 2002, the city experienced its worst ever flood, and the station was a torrent of water a metre deep. Ironically, the damage caused by the floods, and the subsequent insurance payout, were what prompted the restoration of the station building.

The architects' original commission, six years ago, was for the membrane roof only. There is more to do: Foster and Partners have submitted proposals for restoring three small pavilions on the outside of the station, one of which used to be a private entrance for the King, but was later turned into a cinema.

The psychological scars of Dresden's wartime destruction have all but healed, to the extent that news of a British architect working on a local landmark barely raised an eyebrow, but you don't have to walk far beyond the station to see signs of the architectural price Dresden paid. What was once ""the Florence of the Elbe"", the most beautiful baroque city in Europe, is now a strange mix of rebuilt historical buildings, monolithic slabs of postwar socialist architecture, and new shopping and office blocks. The city is due to mark its 800th anniversary next year, and construction, or rather reconstruction, is accelerating. Last October, the huge, domed Frauenkirche, the protestant church that was once the city's symbol, was rededicated after a long, painstaking reconstruction, having stood in ruins for a generation. The project was financed by private and corporate donors, including many from Britain, and the golden cross on its roof was forged by the son of an RAF pilot who took part in the wartime bombing raids. Tourists now throng to see the wedding-cake interior of the church, dripping with tiers of balconies and galleries, all painted in gaudy colours and fake marbling. It is apparently a close approximation of how the building used to look, but it feels more like a three-dimensional stage set - a sad reminder of what's been lost.

A similar strategy is at play in the area around the Frauenkirche, known as the Neumarkt. Dresden's city council has pledged to accurately rebuild about 80 old townhouses and hotels in the area. Many of them have recently been finished - brand new 18th-century architecture with modern glazing and concrete structures beneath the stone cladding. Others are still fenced-off pits in the cobbled streets, containing the foundations of the buildings destroyed in the wartime firestorm.

Among those supporting the traditional reconstruction approach is Prince Charles, and British traditionalist architects such as Robert Adam and Jan Maciag have proposed baroque-style designs for the area. Others have questioned whether trying to turn back the clock to the 1920s is the best response to Dresden's situation. Some would prefer to see the ruins preserved as a memorial, and contemporary architecture built. Foster's Dresden station is removed from this debate, but it does represent a middle way that could please everyone: using current technology set against the past.

It looks deceptively simple, but Foster's project was by no means straightforward. There were intense negotiations with the client, heritage consultants, city officials and other invested parties over what to keep, what to remove and what to reinstate, hence the new stone clock towers. ""There were very intensive discussions over whether Foster's should be doing this sort of thing,"" says Fuls. ""We didn't replace stonework damaged by bullets and bombs in other parts of the building, but we thought it was the right decision here because the damage was done intentionally. Still, we wonder if it was the right thing to do. Maybe in another city we would have done something different. But it's important for many people in Dresden to have things back like they were"".",Dresden's magnificent train station has been restored to its prewar glory - by a British architect.

BUENOS AIRES, April 6 (Reuters) - Argentine central bank regulators entered Citibank Argentina's headquarters on Monday, as the battle intensified between the government and a group of U.S. hedge funds who refuse to accept discounted payment terms on the country's defaulted debt.

Argentina's securities regulator says Citibank Argentina violated local laws by striking a deal with the hedge funds. It has suspended the bank from conducting capital market operations and stripped its CEO's authority.

""There will be an inspection of Citibank Argentina today to ensure it is functioning,"" a central bank spokesman said. The regulators' task will be to monitor operations, not take over management of the bank, he said.

Four inspectors wearing central bank lapel pins were later seen entering the bank's headquarters in Buenos Aires.

A spokesman for Citigroup, Citibank Argentina's parent group, had no comment on the situation.

The case stems from a legal feud being played out in U.S. federal courts between President Cristina Fernandez's government and New York-based hedge funds over the payment terms offered in 2005 and 2010 bond restructurings.

U.S. Judge Thomas Griesa has awarded the hedge funds full payment on the defaulted debt and barred Argentina from servicing its restructured debt until it settles with creditors.

Fernandez refuses to grant the funds better terms than the steep payment cuts accepted by most bondholders in 2005 and 2010. She often derides the funds as ""vultures"" who bought Argentine debt at deeply discounted prices and are willing to bankrupt the country in their pursuit of astronomical profits.

Argentina has insisted that Citibank Argentina, which portrays itself as an innocent party caught in the legal battle, keep processing payments.

Citibank Argentina agreed with the hedge funds not to appeal a U.S. court ruling that interest payments on restructured bonds could not be processed if the bank was allowed to make two one-off payments to help it exit its local custody business.

On April 1, the central bank said Gabriel Ribisich, head of Citibank Argentina, could no longer represent the bank because he ""ignored Argentina's legal framework regarding sovereign debt restructuring.""

Citibank Argentina, the country's 12th largest bank, has appealed the decision to remove Ribisich to the local courts, according to media reports. The Argentine Banking Association said the central bank did not observe ""the constitutional guarantees of due process"" in removing the bank chief.

And the opportunity to bring recreational activities, ecological parks, walkways, public space to the water and giving people access for the first time was really transformational. Because, you know, this water is really dirty. And you don’t want to fall in the water. So there was kind of a resistance to letting kids get out on the water and use it.

BELLAFANTE: Was there a pollution remediation component that went on in conjunction with this project?

GANG: Well, the people that were thinking about this thought that you kind of have to simultaneously let people have access to create a constituency so that people actually care about the river. And then, in that way, they will actually be stewards of the river. So simultaneously, the E.P.A., for example, demanded that the city clean sewage water before putting it back into the river.

BELLAFANTE: So your project was really the catalyst for this other one.

GANG: A catalyst for the whole thing. And then parks and public space are something that we all have as common, you know, civic common areas. And so one of the parks that we worked on in Chicago was this Lincoln Park Zoo. And we made it into kind of a biodiverse place where there’s lots of different animals, not just a lawn with trees, but almost like a zoo without cages. So animals would be attracted. But then people are attracted.

Brownsville, for example, in New York, is a place where we just designed this Fire Rescue 2. It’s a fire rescue facility. There’s one per borough. And here it’s about putting a publicly owned building and making it very open and visible and to help revitalize that part of the city.

BELLAFANTE: I want to say for anyone in the audience who’s not familiar with Brownsville, it’s the poorest neighborhood in New York City, has the highest concentration of public housing. Terrible rates of crime. And what this will do to Brownsville is it really will bring something of aesthetic value into a neighborhood that is very, very desolate and very depressing. There are places you can stand in Brownsville and look 360 degrees, and you’ll only see these monolithic public housing towers. Very little new development.

GANG: But, you know, there is community in Brownsville. So when we started designing this, we developed a way of working with people, asking people from the community what they want to have.

BELLAFANTE: And can you talk a little bit about the way you engaged firemen and what you learned about the culture and community of firemen that influenced —

GANG: What we really noticed was the firefighters — they’re actually rescue workers, not firefighters — like to eat together, and they stay there a few days at a time. And they really develop a community. And so they have their own strong community.

But then that also makes them attractive to the neighbors. You feel like you trust a firefighter, a rescue worker. And those doors on the building are often open. And we even put a bench in the front of the building so people can actually sit there instead of taking this approach of creating a fortress, which I think is a contrast to what we see in the design of police stations.

And so really designing this Fire Rescue 2 started me thinking about, are there ways that design could help improve the relationship between community members and police if we looked at the architecture? Not that it can solve everything. But I think, you know, maybe it can be part of that dialogue in creating — relationships between police and community members which are not just the confrontational relationships.",The architect and founder of Studio Gang is using balconies and common areas in tall buildings to give people visual connections.,33.9090909091,0.5454545455,0.6363636364,medium,low,abstractive,architecture

The NSW government recently rejected a heritage listing bid for the harbourside Sirius building, which has been used for public housing since it was built more than 30 years ago.

Hundreds of protesters marched from Alfred Street, around the Quay, meeting at the base of the Brutalist building on Saturday morning.

The vocal crowd, flanked by police officers, were addressed by several opponents of the building's slated demolition, including Lord Mayor Clover Moore and opposition planning minister Michael Daley.

""If the government applies this policy to other inner city areas, it will destroy the social mix - the very soul of city - and we will fight that all the way,"" Ms Moore said from the back of a truck in front of the building.

""This housing is needed just as much now, or even more, because the majority of social housing residents in Millers Point have already been dispersed.""

The mixed-bag of protesters included unionists, architects and social housing advocates.

The CFMEU granted a Green Ban over the building earlier this week, in an attempt to stall demolition plans.

Michael Daley warned the Baird government any attempt to tear down the building, built in 1979, would be met by fierce opposition.

""We're here to say to Mike Baird, if you try and cheat the people of Sydney out of the Sirius building, when you come down here with your developer and your banker mates, we'll be waiting,"" Mr Daley said.

Architects Olivia Savio-Matev and Hugo Raggett said the Sirius building held more than just architectural importance in Sydney.

""We're here to support and save the heritage architecture of Sydney, but also to support the residents who are being evicted.""

""I think the governments stance on this building is purely a money grab.""

The Sirius building is not the only inner-city public housing on the chopping block, with the NSW Government also selling houses in Millers Point to private buyers.",A rally will be held to push for the controversial Sirius building to be listed on the NSW heritage register.,19.8095238095,0.8095238095,1.0952380952,medium,medium,abstractive,architecture

He managed to keep in the background when his chairman, Neil Cossons, presided over an ill-fated attempt to head off the epidemic of tall buildings that is threatening to turn London into Shanghai-on-Thames. But it is Thurley who is now making the running in what looks suspiciously like a stand for the organisation's credibility by fighting two cabinet ministers (Tessa Jowell and Margaret Beckett) and their attempt to demolish London's Commonwealth Institute. Having failed to stop the skyscrapers, or even to protect Fortress House, the neo-Palladian Savile Row office building which used to be his own headquarters (now threatened with demolition), he has no choice.

He deserves to succeed: the fate of the Commonwealth Institute is one of those turning points in the history of taste, like the Euston Arch, the great Doric Victorian entrance to the station demolished in 1962 in the name of modernisation at exactly the moment that the Commonwealth Institute was being built. It was designed by the dependable but stolid practice started by Sir Robert Matthew, known as RMJM. Inspired by Le Corbusier's Philips pavilion at the Brussels expo a few years earlier, this was the one project with which RMJM decided to kick over the traces. The firm produced a modish hyperbolic parabaloid roof, sitting like a witch's hat perched precariously on a blue box.

It was designed to house the Commonwealth Institute's collection of handpainted dioramas celebrating the finer points of bauxite-mining in British Guiana, tea-planting in Ceylon and rubber-growing in Malaya, which I, for one, remember with a certain fondness from my school days.

When it was new, this was as modern as official London got: a slightly shocking intrusion to the skyline against the backdrop of a Royal Park, with an interior that had something of the flavour of an expo. Of course, that fragile-looking roof leaked almost from the beginning and, as coup followed coup, the dioramas couldn't keep up with changing political and economic realities. The building's present ramshackle state, betraying brave hopes gone sour, is a pretty accurate reflection of the Commonwealth itself.

Even though the government has already poured £3 million into attempting to patch up the building, it is now empty, a victim of policy shifts as well as technical problems. The Commonwealth Institute wants to be allowed to sell the site for development and use the cash generated for educational programmes in the poorer member countries. Vigorous lobbying by a secretary-general determined to play the Africa card, by suggesting that the obscurantist efforts of conservationists are snatching the bread from the mouths of countless million orphans who have never seen inside a school, has persuaded two cabinet ministers to ignore the advice of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, and back a private act of Parliament to have the structure stripped of the protection of listing. It's a process that is going to divert the Commonwealth's precious resources into the hands of its lawyers rather than the poor.

The building is a reminder of an almost forgotten, but significant moment in Britain's recent history, and its attempt to get to grips with its post-colonial future, presenting the Commonwealth as a viable contemporary alternative to the outdated concept of Empire. On those grounds alone, it is an important monument to preserve, in the same way that Berliners fought to save the former East German parliament building, or a younger generation of Muscovites are struggling to stop the demolition of all the relics of Stalinism by cowboy capitalist developers in league with the mayor.

Apart from its historical significance, the Commonwealth Institute demonstrates that the Sixties were about more than brute concrete. And at a moment when London is going through a period of unprecedentedly rapid change, there is a strong case to be made for retaining as many of the city's defining landmarks as possible.

The case against the Commonwealth Institute rests on the fact that its owners believe that they have no further use for it. That of course is exactly what was once said about the Roundhouse, St Pancras Station, the Royal Exchange in Manchester, the Albert Docks in Liverpool and countless other troublesome redundant buildings. Why not try out a range of other possibilities, even as a temporary market, or exhibition space, until a more secure long-term future can be found for it?

Thurley is vowing to fight, putting both sides in line for colossal legal fees. But he has no option. If a building of this scale and quality is demolished, it calls the whole point of the listing system into question.

The Commonwealth Institute belongs to the same moment in architectural history as the even more decayed, but more distinguished, seminary in Cardross, designed by Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. The seminary now sits rotting in ruins on the edge of Glasgow, covered in graffiti, which suggests that Britain has yet to take the architecture of the Sixties to its heart. But then in the Sixties, the Victorian architecture that is now so valued was just as neglected and unfashionable.

Unwelcome Visitors The newly established London Architecture Biennale, now in full swing, has overtaken the longer established but worthier Architecture Week as the architectural profession's premier charm offensive. It's an attempt to persuade a sceptical world that architecture is neither a private religion, nor a cabal plotting to foist the unbuildable and the uninhabitable on to a hapless public.

One architect who I suspect will not be found mourning over the destruction of the Commonwealth Institute is Quinlan Terry, who is doing a drawing workshop at Riba's headquarters during Architecture Week. It's hard to know which is the least likely: that the profession should invite a man who has devoted the past 40 years to cultivating a distinctly uncordial distaste for its leading lights whom he sees as conspiring to do him down, or that Terry should consent actually to set foot inside the Riba's Portland Place building.

Certainly from the tone of Radical Classicism, the new monograph that Terry will be promoting in the institute, nothing has been forgiven, or forgotten. The Cambridge art historian David Watkin's text couldn't be clearer. 'The modernism with which Quinlan Terry has had to battle is, like the Taliban, a puritanical religion.' But then Riba is facing an even less welcome visitor, in the shape of Peter Phillips, the BNP activist running for president.

The principles driving urban renaissance are social inclusion and high-quality architecture. This is the first British government to encourage people back into our cities, and its sustainable vision of a compact, live-work, well-connected city has brought vitality back to many of our run-down cities and neighbourhoods.

But something is seriously wrong when, seven years after John Prescott asked me to chair the Urban Task Force, we have yet to compete with the best in Europe in the quality of new housing.

The cities we most love to visit and live in have one thing in common. From classical Athens to renaissance Venice, from Georgian London to a hill-top Tuscan town, vitality and civic pride have been boosted by glorious public spaces enclosed by well-designed buildings. These breathtaking places are the result of the collaborative efforts of clients, architects and builders. Beautiful cities do not just happen; they are made.

Architecture is the process of embodying beauty and function in the built environment. It brings order, proportion, light and beauty to space. Pretending that architectural quality is mere subjectivity is dangerously irresponsible: there are well-established criteria and standards for judgment. Understanding and appreciation come from education, experience, the fine-tuning of our senses, and - perhaps most importantly - good professional leadership. And yet we have miserably failed to put the best architects at the heart of the decision-making process. This is a golden age for architecture, and yet we risk repeating the mistakes of the postwar era.

Thames Gateway is the largest urban-regeneration project in Europe, set to accommodate up to a million people - a city as big as Manchester - along the glorious river Thames from the Isle of Dogs to Southend. It should be the most exciting project in Europe, but I remain deeply concerned as to whether it will fulfil its potential.

As chair of the Urban Task Force and more recently as Ken Livingstone's chief adviser on architecture, I have urged planners and politicians to treat London Thames Gateway (the 90 square kilometres of Thames Gateway within the Greater London boundary) as a piece of a compact city, such as Manhattan or Barcelona, rather than as a disconnected series of new towns. We need to take a comprehensive but sensitive approach, evaluating existing land, communities and transport uses against what could be.

Barcelona sets an example. Long after the 1992 Olympics, it still impresses residents and visitors alike. This magnificent Mediterranean city, laid waste by a brutal combination of fascist government and declining industry, has bounded back in style - stunning beaches and vibrant neighbourhoods, epitomising the live-work-leisure mix to which all modern cities aspire.

London is richer than Barcelona, culturally and physically, but when I look at what is being built, I fear we are about to lose a great opportunity. Our most precious sites are being defiled by alien lines of low- and high-rise doll's houses, occasionally interrupted by Dan Dare steel and glass towers with no regard for context or relationship with their surroundings. Tacky bungalows are creeping aimlessly along the banks of the Thames, one of the world's most magnificent rivers. Plastic clapboard and tiles, imitation stone, shoddy concrete and tiny windows facing the best views are symptoms of barbarity.

So why is Barcelona thriving, while London still struggles to match even the lowest standards of design? Barcelona's resurrection was the result of 18 years of urban planning under three outstanding mayors who worked closely with visionary architects, artists, scientists and sociologists to transform their city.

Pasqual Maragall's appointment of, and close relationship with, the great Catalan architect Oriol Bohigas was crucial in giving form to this vision. Together with his colleague, and the present city planner, Josep Acebillo, he prepared a three-dimensional urban strategy for the city - and then realised it by appointing some of the best architects in Europe to deliver project after project, never losing site of either the vision or the detail.

John Prescott and Ken Livingstone believe that there is no urban renaissance without design, but we struggle even to reach what other European cities would see as acceptable standards. There is no proper policy framework for design excellence: there are too many organisations, with too little focus on delivering quality. The government and its quangos and housebuilders need to put skilled architects at the forefront of the urban renaissance. Without them we shall never achieve our aspirations.

In London, faced with the need for at least 400,000 more dwellings by 2016 to meet the capital's population growth, Ken Livingstone made a brilliant and brave policy decision to contain the growth within the green belt and the 32 existing boroughs. He went beyond the government's target of 60% of development to be on brownfield (previously developed) land by aiming at 100%.

But the mayor's powers are seriously limited by the inheritance of nearly 15 years without metropolitan government and by the lack of focus on design that infects all parts of British political life. The small team that supports me at the Greater London Authority, the Architecture and Urbanism Unit, has commissioned and prepared some excellent masterplans especially in London Thames Gateway with the London Development Agency. We have appointed some exceptional European architects through open competitions, but we have very limited powers to deliver well-designed buildings, public spaces or public transport infrastructure. Every decision has to be dumbed down through negotiation with countless agencies, many of which lack vision and specialist skills.

Without a structural hierarchy, decision-making is left in a quagmire of mediocrity. Many of the delivery bodies operate first and foremost as land dealers and surveyors concerned with numbers and management, not design. Among the bodies I deal with, only the new London Thames Gateway has an architect on its board.

Unless the mayor is empowered, and given a greater say in this multitude of poorly coordinated quangos, we shall never produce a sustainable policy or design to compare to the best abroad. And if we don't get the design of cities and neighbourhoods right then all our work on crime, education, health, jobs and social exclusion will be undermined.

There are ways of getting it right. Much of today's best development is done through competitions. But these are only as good as the jury. When I was adviser to President Mitterrand on the Grands Projets in Paris, he insisted that juries should include good architects. In the UK, you are lucky if you find one architect on a jury of 10. And even when this process does allow you to select talented architects, there is no guarantee that their designs will survive beyond the planning process. Having served their purpose in securing planning permission, the architects are dumped and plots are packaged up for developers.

While we continue to treat architecture as a marginalised ""add-on"", quantity will always prevail over quality, mammon over imagination. To construct cities around the belief that urban design and the public realm can be considered once land deals, planning policy and economic viability have been settled, is to submit our cities to a form of vandalism from which few will recover.

The oath that Hellenic Greeks made when they became citizens leaves us with a powerful message: ""We shall leave this city not less but greater, better and more beautiful than it was left to us."" Unless we empower our civic leaders to create beautiful cities, we will not just repeat our past mistakes, but condemn our children to live with them and in them.

The FTSE 100 company said that new home completions were up 8pc during the year, driving up revenues to £2.9bn. In the second half of the year, that rate was even stronger, up 13pc on the first half.

It added that 14,572 new homes were completed in 2015, compared to 13,509 in 2014.

The average selling price for houses increased by 4.5pc to £199,100, reflecting the increase in house prices in Britain in 2015, which Halifax today put at 9.5pc.

The company also said forward sales were 13pc ahead of 2014, and that it had opened 250 new sites during the year.

The statement from Persimmon, which builds houses across the UK except in central London, suggested a positive outlook, having benefitted from government schemes to help first-time buyers.

Persimmon said: “The consistent application of the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework is supporting improvements in land release for development and the additional initiatives recently announced in the Autumn Statement should help further.“

The board also announced the resignations of three board members – including Nigel Greenaway, chief executive of the company’s southern division, who is retiring.

So overwhelming is the presence of the elder Wright in the American architectural consciousness that there is barely room for any other Wrights. With a father like Frank Lloyd Wright, how could any architect-son make his presence felt?

The exhibition of drawings that opened Wednesday at the Max Protetch Gallery, 37 West 57th Street, might be considered an attempt to give Lloyd Wright, who died in 1978, some ground of his own. It is well deserved: the younger Wright, who practiced in Los Angeles, was, in fact, a very good architect, and had he been called Wright Lloyd instead of Lloyd Wright his reputation might have amounted to something more than it was.

Lloyd Wright was among the very best of the many architects who followed closely in Frank Lloyd Wright's footsteps. His work was not startlingly original; it was highly derivative of his father's style. But Lloyd Wright's buildings consistently had a kind of strength and self-assurance, not to mention a certain spark, that were lacking in most of the Wrightian architecture that was not from the senior Wright's own hand.

Lloyd Wright, who was born in 1890, began his career as a renderer for his father, and helped prepare many of the exquisite drawings of Frank Lloyd Wright's work that made up the celebrated Wasmuth portfolio, published in Europe in 1910. His own interests turned toward landscape architecture, and he worked for a time for the Boston firm that had been started by Frederick Law Olmsted.

He went to Los Angeles in 1919 to assist his father in the landscaping for the Hollyhock House, the expansive residence for Aline Barnsdall that was the senior Wright's first commission in California. Lloyd Wright never left Los Angeles, and his interests moved more toward architecture; as early as 1922 he was designing houses on his own, even as he continued to work in association with his father.

Lloyd Wright's first house, for Henry Bollman, is a handsome concrete-block structure that actually predates the far more celebrated group of concrete-block houses done by Frank Lloyd Wright in Los Angeles in the 1920's. Later in the decade, Lloyd Wright designed the first and then the second stage shells that became the Hollywood Bowl, and continued to produce house designs that inventively expanded on themes that were his father's.

Like his father, Lloyd Wright had a penchant for the grand building gesture, and produced numerous designs for immense cultural centers, multi-level urban renewal projects, and religious and educational compounds. Some, like the Institute of Mentalphysics, designed in the late 1950's for Yucca Valley, Calif., were wildly extravagant, almost science-fiction-like in their imagery. None of these mega-projects were built, and, ironically, his most famous building is relatively small: the Wayfarer's Chapel, a particularly graceful structure of glass and wood overlooking the Pacific Ocean at Palos Verdes, Calif., which was designed and built over the years 1946 to 1971.

Still, for all that is good about this architecture - and for all that is truly lovely about many of the drawings on view here, for Lloyd Wright was a more graceful draftsman than his father - it is hard not to see the underlying theme of this exhibition not as architecture at all, but as an essay on the poignancy of the relationship of an eager and earnest son to a very famous father. Lloyd Wright never fully found his own voice; he never broke away from his father, and while his architecture had a degree of theatricality and flamboyance that took it beyond even the bravado of the senior Wright's work, it was not fundamentally different. It is hard not to think of where Lloyd Wright's creative energies might have taken him had he entered life, and architecture, without the overpowering presence of Frank Lloyd Wright above him.

Yet Lloyd Wright's buildings were not directly and simplistically imitative, as were the buildings of so many of Frank Lloyd Wright's disciples, particularly those who to this day continue Wright's own practice as Taliesin Associated Architects. Lloyd Wright never joined the Frank Lloyd Wright circle at Taliesin; he did not follow his father like a sheep.

We might, in the end, say that Lloyd Wright never capitulated entirely to his father's immensely powerful presence, but he never tried to outdo him, either. What is so touching is that he seems so much to have wanted to be a true colleague, a peer - and faced with a father like Frank Lloyd Wright, that, of course, was the hardest kind of father-son relationship of all to sustain.

The show runs through Feb. 7.","LEAD: THE work of the architect Lloyd Wright, the eldest son of Frank Lloyd Wright, has been all but ignored beside that of his more famous father.

The BBC should get its history straight,1970-08-22 05:33:51.163831,"There's no denying art deco's attraction: it's the style of 1930s cinemas, ocean liners and flamboyant Manhattan skyscrapers. It conjures Hollywood, Busby Berkeley musicals, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in Top Hat. It makes you think of glamorous climes – whether Miami, Havana, New York or Shanghai – in which buildings that seemed to be encrusted with fashionable jewellery gleam in the summer sun. It's also a style that's been much in vogue recently, because of BBC4's Glamour's Golden Age season, which includes a series of documentaries by David Heathcote on art deco icons.

But here's the funny thing: Britain doesn't actually have much in the way of art deco architecture. Even London has just a sprinkling of buildings: Ideal House, a black granite-clad office block off Regent's Street designed by Raymond Hood; The Odeon, Leicester Square; and the glorious Daily Express building in Fleet Street, with its spectacular, cinema-style entrance lobby by Robert Atkinson. Outside London, cinemas are the most shining examples of the style – Harry Weedon's Odeons are the best (all too many converted into bingo halls or graceless multiplexes), along with shop fronts. Manchester and Glasgow have their own dramatically deco Daily Express buildings, both dramatic examples. If you look hard enough, you can detect deco influences in the buildings of Liverpool's Speke Airport (now a hotel) and even in the suburban stations of the old Southern Railway, such as Surbiton.

But it's never a style that really took root in Britain. Which makes it all the odder that the BBC has decided to label buildings art deco that aren't. In his documentaries, Heathcote devoted much time to Charles Holden's 55 Broadway, the headquarters of London Underground, describing it as ""a fantastic art deco building"". Holden would have turned in his grave at the description. Influenced by contemporary US architecture, yes. And detailed inside in ways that might suggest art deco. But an art deco icon? No.

This isn't entirely Heathcote's fault. Television thrives on telling stories with the broadest of brush strokes. And art deco has become something of a catch-all title in recent years, used to describe almost any building, piece of furniture, bronze lamp or ceramic dish designed between about 1925 and 1940. I've seen Albert Speer's Reich Chancellery for Adolf Hitler described as art deco and even – a mortal sin, surely? – Le Corbusier's coolly modern Villa Savoye in the suburbs of Paris tainted with the same label. The term itself was something of a latecomer. It wasn't much used before the design historian Bevis Hillier published his delightful book Art Deco of the 20s and 30s in 1968, defining a style that had more usually been known as moderne, modernistic and jazz modern.

The style emerged from the legendary Exposition Internationale des Art Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes held in Paris in 1925 – a grand showing of design and decoration, from furniture and accessories to interiors and architecture, mapped out in acres of precious veneers, marble and onyx, stainless steel and aluminium, all much influenced by Egyptian, Babylonian and Assyrian archaeology. It was this licentious playfulness that provoked the contempt of the rising stars of the Modern movement – modernism – which had been rooted in the far more serious researches of the Bauhaus and, most notably, Le Corbusier. Modernists held art deco in contempt: it was all but sinful. A travesty. Low and dishonest. Downright vulgar – it was the stuff of fashion rather than function, of escapism rather than realism.

When Nikolaus Pevsner, the architecture and design historian, went to see the cinematic Hoover Factory on London's Western Avenue, built by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners (1931–5), he described it in the Middlesex volume of his The Buildings of England series as ""perhaps the most offensive of the modernistic atrocities along this road of typical bypass factories"". (A comment that was toned down to something substantially less angry in the revised edition of the book, published in 1991.)

And whereas Modern architecture, for better or worse, influenced the British landscape for decades to come, art deco never really took flight. It remained in domestic settings: hinted at in the stained-glass sunrises of mock-Tudor front doors, echoed in the interiors of 1930s MG sports saloons. It conjured fantasy and escapism at a time when the world could be a very grim place indeed.

Perhaps some of the same escapism touches our view of art deco. It's a way of looking at the past through neon-tinted glasses. By all means, watch Top Hat, gawp at the Chrysler Building, imagine yourself sipping cocktails aboard an ocean liner – let the dark and disturbing interwar era become the stuff of ritzy cinematic dreams. But life in the 1930s was more complicated. And while it's understandable that the BBC should have fallen for art deco's charms, it might have been better if they had got their history straight.",BBC4's recent series on 1930s architecture looks at Britain's art-deco history through neon-tinted glasses.

Even animals that don't need to be quarantined - a huge dog that can't fit in the cabin and has to travel as cargo, for example—will be held at the facility until departure or pickup by its owner.

""A lot of our design making is in collaboration with veterinarians and consultants to help minimize the amount of stress placed on the animal,"" said Cliff Bollmann, a leading airport architect working on The ARK for the San Francisco-based architecture firm Gensler.

Kennedy receives the bulk of animals entering the United States, but there are similar facilities near airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and San Juan. Until Kennedy's ARK opens, animals in transit will continue to be handled at the airport's aging 10,000-foot Vetport, built in the 1950s.

Lachlan Oldaker, an Oklahoma-based equine specialist and key member of the architectural team, called The ARK ""an enormous leap forward.""

""The design allows planes to taxi directly to the building, so horses can be transported in a seamless fashion that reduces stress,"" she said.

The ARK is being built on the site of an unused cargo terminal that has been demolished. ARK Development, an affiliate of the Madison Avenue real estate company Racebrook Capital, has signed a 32-year lease for the airport property with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agency that runs Kennedy.

When completed, the facility is subject to approval by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Animals will be charged fees - still being determined depending on services - that will help fund the terminal. High-end dog ""suites"" could top $100 per night.

Transporting animals by air is not aimed at low-income owners. A flight to London for a dog can cost about $1,000, plus a crate, airport fees and vet certifications. And moving a horse can add up to at least $10,000.

The ARK's designers have had to meet challenges not found in other architectural projects - for instance, figuring out how to dispose of animal waste. They came up with the idea of a ""poo chute,"" an angled floor from which manure slides into a container.

Among the supporters of this unusual animal kingdom is Dr. Richard Goldstein, the chief medical officer at New York's Animal Medical Center, which treats sick animals of all species from around the world.

""Our veterinarians have often been in a position of having to arrange transport for many of our travelling patients at all hours of the day and night, and will look forward to working with The ARK to make this experience better for everyone involved,"" Goldstein said.

But even when it comes to healthy animals, the equine wing is a welcome improvement to international show jumper and organizer Derek Braun.

Horses must currently be driven to a quarantine facility in Newburgh, about 80 miles north of Kennedy. The ARK has an in-house quarantine.

""I personally, as well as competitors for my shows, ship so many horses from Europe each year that having the peace of mind that one step of the travel process will be eliminated is a big relief because it eliminates part of the risk of injury,"" he said.",Kennedy airport in NYC is building the first ever air terminal for animals.,47.9285714286,0.7857142857,0.7857142857,high,medium,abstractive,architecture
http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/sep/26/architecture,http://web.archive.org/web/20140919213154id_/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/sep/26/architecture,The art of designing theatres,1970-08-22 02:41:59.213154,"Architects and theatre directors have a lot in common: they're both used to dealing with abstract spatial qualities as well as nuts, bolts, pounds and pennies; they're both notorious for working right up to the deadline; and above all, they're both used to running the show. No wonder they rarely get along.

The granddaddy of modern theatre, Peter Brook, threw down the gauntlet with his 1968 tract The Empty Space, which begins with the lines: ""I can take any empty space and call it a bare stage."" Brook stuck to his word and based his operations in a ruined 19th-century music hall outside Paris; 30 years later, he still maintains he's never found a modern architect-designed theatre he likes. Many a director since has either followed suit (Ariane Mnouchkine's Cartoucherie complex, for example, built in a former munitions factory) or railed against the architectural burden they've been lumbered with (Richard Eyre's diaries are full of his struggles to fill the impractical expanse of the National Theatre's Olivier auditorium). What other area of activity would sooner dispense with architects altogether?

""All the interesting practitioners say the same thing about buildings: 'Why is it that we can't build permissive, exciting, beautiful, available theatre space? Why is it that so many of our new buildings feel corporate, overmanaged, overfinished, icily perfect and therefore alienating to a process which by its nature is exploratory and provisional?'"" That's not Brook talking: it's Steve Tompkins, an architect. He's one half of Haworth Tompkins, a young firm who seem to have mastered the art of designing theatres that theatre people like.

Their remodelling of the Royal Court, in London's Sloane Square, set things off five years ago, with a universally praised combination of unpolished practicality and sensual urban chic. They've since installed the Almeida theatre's exciting temporary homes - a disused bus depot in King's Cross and a hulking former power station in Shoreditch - and renovated the Regent's Park open-air theatre. At present, they're halfway through rebuilding another London institution, the Young Vic; meanwhile, their Egg children's theatre opens next month in Bath. Beyond that, the theatre-related work continues: a research lab for the National, a school theatre in Oxford, the V&A's Theatre Museum.

""We would never describe ourselves as theatre specialists,"" says Tompkins. ""You do one building and it seems to work out, but we found we had a taste for it, a passion."" The passion goes beyond building theatres: a theatregoer since childhood, from a family of amateur performers, and married to someone in the business, Tompkins already had a foot in the theatre world.

""I feel a lot of empathy for what theatre-makers are trying to do,"" he says. ""A lot of it is counter-intuitive to people trained as architects. Often, the very things that architects would identify as intensely problematic turn out to have been the things that were sustaining the creative life of the organisation. One has to be careful not to argue for poor theatres, but there is something inherently creative to theatre-makers - certainly ones that I've come across - about raw, unfinished spaces.""

So far, Haworth Tompkins' theatre projects have all dealt with ""found space"", and they've become used to making the most of what's already there. At the Royal Court, for example, the architects juxtaposed ancient surfaces and new elements rather than smoothing them into an ""icily perfect"" whole. Tompkins retained the 19th-century auditorium but peeled back some outer layers to reveal the riveted ironwork holding it together. On the outside wall of the auditorium drum, meanwhile, artist Antoni Malinowski applied a vibrant vermilion coat that shines like a beacon into the square.

""Even though it is a carefully wrought scheme, hopefully it has that sense of being able to be knocked, kicked, scuffed,"" says Tompkins. ""The whole palette of the building is about patination and the evident passage of time, because practitioners use spaces they like again and again, and they're aware of performances and performers who've used the spaces before. There was a myth about Olivier's handprints being on the back stairs, for example. I don't think they ever really were, but there was concern over losing them. Mind you, we still demolished them.""

At its extremes, there's almost an element of set design to this type of work - the distinction between theatrical and architectural space starts to blur. Especially in cases like the temporary Almeida spaces, where Tompkins had just a few months and £700,000 to transform empty shells into practicable, commercial venues. ""The theatre technicians and set builders worked alongside our carpenters and builders, and there was a pretty seamless relationship,"" says Tompkins. ""We were finishing the theatre as the dress rehearsals were going on, literally.""

The Young Vic redevelopment was a natural fit for Tompkins' approach. The theatre's original designer, Bill Howell, also strove to work with his theatrical clients. The result was an auditorium that's still one of London's best loved, despite the fact that it was designed as a temporary breeze block structure, and, 35 years on, is surrounded by a virtual shanty town of leaking, rotting, cluttered and confined spaces. Just as Howell incorporated the tiled butcher's shop that still stood on the original bombed-out site, so Tompkins is retaining the butcher's shop and the essence of Howell's auditorium, although he's expanded its capacity by 200 people. ""The holy grail of auditoria is more people into same space,"" Tompkins explains. ""It's like an electromagnet: the more coils you can get the more current you can generate.""

He's also giving the complex much-needed breathing space: two new studios, a double-height foyer, accommodation for performers and staff, and a flexible circulation system connecting them all. There will be a rough approach to the interiors: plywood sheets, concrete floors, unfinished timber and red-primed steelwork. The spaces will acquire theatricality through theatrical means, says Tompkins, such as lighting. For the street facade, he has commissioned artist Clem Crosby to hand paint industrial panels with a pattern of cadmium yellow over black. These will be assembled randomly, behind a giant gauze of aluminium mesh.

Is there a possibility that the thrill of seeing a play in an unconventional place will overshadow the quality of the drama? Found-space theatre is in danger of becoming another exotic bourgeois diversion, a problem that Tompkins acknowledges. But the same techniques Tompkins has used for trendy London spaces, he's also applying in less fashionable areas, such as the Egg, a children's theatre in Bath. Essentially, it's another conversion of an empty, historic structure, in this case a 19th-century cinema. But this is a theatre so small that adults will have to bend and squeeze to negotiate their way around it.

Two 15-year-olds interviewed the architects for the job and told them exactly what they wanted: in a word, playfulness. The auditorium is a horseshoe of red corrugated plastic and industrial metalwork. ""An adult client for a 120-seat auditorium would never have come up with this, and I don't think we would have on our own either,"" says Tompkins. ""We'd never have thought of making an elliptical theatre. It has some of the qualities of a Victorian playhouse, and a sense of glamour.""

The Egg opens next month. Meanwhile, the Young Vic has already passed its first audition: a visit from Peter Brook himself. The director, who regularly uses the venue for his London shows, reportedly demanded a £10,000 refit of the dressing rooms before he would stage his Hamlet there in 2001. Could this be a purpose-built theatre he might actually like? It ought to be, since Tompkins hired Brooks' design collaborators, Jean-Guy Lecat and Andrew Todd, as consultants. ""It was a charged moment, that's for sure,"" Tompkins admits, ""but happily he was very complimentary. I think he had always liked it but found it too low. But now we've raised the ceiling and expanded the capacity, I think he saw a lot more opportunities in the space.""

After this next round of curtains has risen, perhaps someone will ask Tompkins to design a brand new theatre. ""I wish they would!"" he laughs. ""We're trying to learn the lessons of these found spaces and these hybrid spaces and see if we can start to develop a thesis for building new theatres. That will be a very interesting project.""","If they could, theatre directors would ban architects from coming anywhere near their buildings.

No,1970-08-22 02:42:05.080603,"Does London need a ""design tsar""? No. The last time a tsar tried to design a capital city, he chose to build on swamp infested with mosquitoes. St Petersburg might be beautiful in a deathly, Venetian manner, yet Peter the Great, though not nearly as ambitious as Ken Livingstone, proved to be neither the wisest nor most humane city planner.

London is too big, too miasmic for its ""design"", so far as it could ever have one, to be controlled by one six-figure salary man, or even a pair sharing the job, as Will Alsop and Paul Finch would like.

The city might be better served by a planning forum capable of bringing ideas and developments openly and intelligently into public view for discussion. It might be backed up by a school of planning where the lost art of city making could be nurtured.

What London doesn't need is ambitious individuals representing particular architectural factions and design interests. It needs a forum that will openly question the need for a new generation of gas-guzzling, Shanghai-style skyscrapers - the SUVs of the architectural world - when there are far more environmentally sensitive and socially acceptable alternatives. It needs a forum that will not push new forms of architecture simply because they are ""sexy"" or ""iconic"".

The city needs a forum whose members would wish no other personal gain than the satisfaction of seeing one of the world's greatest cities develop thoughtfully and well - counsellors to a marriage of happy surprises and common sense.

A small cottage hospital built of mud bricks, timber and tin can be found in the floodplain town of Wilcannia, some 600 miles out of Sydney, along the Barrier Highway. Founded in the 1860s, Wilcannia was proclaimed the future ""capital of the west"", and it is a mark of its Victorian ambition that the small town still boasts a number of dignified public buildings. Among them is the white sandstone hospital, designed by Cyril Blacket (architect, with his father, Edmund, of St George's Cathedral, Perth) and built in 1879. Although added to in the 1950s and listed by the National Trust, the hospital has long been outmoded. But now it has been renovated and, in the process, spawned a new genus of architecture: Aboriginal Australian.

The team of architects behind it, Merrima, came together in 1995 and work under the umbrella of the New South Wales department of public works. The practice, led by Dillon Kombumerri, Kevin O'Brien and Alison Page, is staffed by indigenous people, ""committed to the struggle for self-determination through cultural expression in the built environment"". The venture is believed to be the first of its kind in Australia.

The newly reopened hospital for the Far West Ward Aboriginal Health Service, on the banks of the Darling river, is an expression of Merrima's concern. In bald terms, it comprises the restored Victorian clinic, minus the 1950s additions, and a new, lightweight residential block gathered around an internal courtyard and built mostly of timber, corrugated metal and locally made mud bricks. But what was clear at the outset of the project was that the new block should reflect Aboriginal concerns and beliefs.

Despite its grand ambitions, Wilcannia never survived the arrival of the roads and railways that bypassed the town. Today its population is about 1,000, two-thirds of whom are descendants of the Barkindji people, the original inhabitants of the area. And this local population, says Kombumerri, has a strong affinity with the hospital building - ""even though they were originally segregated from non-Aboriginal patients and treated in tents at the back"".

More importantly, Kombumerri says that from the earliest consultations it was clear that ""the proposed redevelopment must address the Darling river, which has spiritual and cultural significance for the Barkindji people. This generated an idea to insert a new building into the story of the river landscape. If the building was going to somehow belong to the river, then we believed it had to be seen to have evolved from the river. Its design and structure were extracted from an understanding of the river's 'living' qualities. So, for example, 'walls' and 'roofs' become 'skins' and 'fins'.""

The new building has an organic, almost animal-like quality. At first sight, it appears to have wings fluttering from its sides; on closer inspection these prove to be timber shutters. The surrounding landscape is big, bare, scrubby and scorched for much of the year, but the building is designed to keep the fierce afternoon sun at bay, so it feels cooler and shadier here than first-time visitors might expect. The internal courtyard provides shade in summer and sun-drenched areas in winter, and is so welcoming that it has become a meeting place for local people, who like to hang out there. The building needs very little artificially generated energy - sunlight falls into offices, surgeries, bedrooms, kitchen and laundry, while mud bricks offer excellent heat insulation - making the clinic a more healthy organism than the average air-conditioned hospital.

If the building was to belong to the local people as much as to the health authority, it was felt that they needed to work on it. Instead of importing building materials, Merrima encouraged the production of locally baked bricks and set up a training scheme for labourers and craft workers. The result, says Kombumerri, is materials that are ""low maintenance, high performance as well as being appealing to the community"".

The Merrima story is a remarkable one. To date, only six Aboriginals have obtained a tertiary degree in architecture, and two more in interior design, across the whole of Australia, according to Kombumerri. He is a descendant of the Kombumerri tribe from the Gold Coast, Queensland; O'Brien is a descendant of the Meriam Mer peoples of Murray Island in the Torres Strait, and Page, the team's interior designer, is a Tharawal woman from La Perouse. ""Aboriginal people today can maintain their essential difference while still embracing modern technologies,"" Kombumerri argues. ""It is our aim as indigenous designers to achieve a culturally sensitive response through understanding this synergetic fusion. Our approach to architecture is about coming to terms with the realities of modern society shaped by multicultural influences.""

In the past four years, the practice has been on a roll in New South Wales, designing and building a wealth of cultural, domestic and academic as well as health, welfare and prison buildings and interiors. Kombumerri's first design was the recently completed Girrawaa Creative Work Centre for the indigenous inmates of the Bathurst Correctional Centre, a remarkably gentle-looking and lightweight building that, according to its architect, presents ""a positive response to deaths [of indigenous people] in custody. The building provides opportunities for the men to develop skills, build self-esteem and strengthen Aboriginal pride."" The team is now working on the Aboriginal Health and Research Centre, a residential healthcare building overlooking the ocean at Little Bay, south Sydney that promises to be striking, urbane and environmentally sound.

Significantly, Merrima is not hooked on the idea of a search for a true Australian identity in architecture - because no one knows what that is. Glenn Murcutt, one of Australia's most celebrated architects, recently said that ""if we set out to design an architecture that's Australian, we're in trouble. All we'd end up with is [the equivalent of] people riding bicycles with kangaroos on them. The important thing is that we address the issues, the landscape, the brief, the place; if we address these things, and do them rationally and poetically at the same time, then we'll be getting somewhere.""

Merrima addresses these things, but at the same time makes clear that it is also an architect's responsibility to address the building's local community, its sense of identity. It is the architect's job to give physical expression to that sense of identity and place without resorting to ""neo-vernacular"" whimsy or kitsch folksiness - design pot-holes that Merrima has skilfully avoided. Not surprisingly, its characterful and caring Wilcannia hospital has already picked up design, environmental, health and heritage awards in New South Wales; when better known, it should win universal admiration. As in fact, should all the practice's buildings: each one expressing a new architecture, involving local people, that is expressive, confident, mature and decidedly Australian.",This award-winning hospital in New South Wales heralds a new style of building design: Aboriginal Australian.

“It’s been a long time coming,” said Rob-Roy Quinzani, a descendant of the Italian immigrant brothers who opened the business in 1919. “There’s presently no one in the fourth generation to hand it down to.”

The Harrison Street building is under agreement, Quinzani said, but he declined to identify the buyer. The company employs about 90 workers.

It’s a familiar story amid the city’s development boom: a blue-collar business shuts down as a gritty neighborhood goes upscale, paving the way for investors to put up a luxury residence or high-end retail buildings.

This corner of the South End still has plenty of grit: Roughly 500 homeless people reside at the Pine Street Inn, a shelter across the street from the bakery. The Ho Kong Bean Sprout Co. next door is still in business.

But the once-largely industrial neighborhood has become one of the city’s hottest real estate markets, due in part to new zoning guidelines that allow buildings as tall as 200 feet. A block from Quinzani’s, the new Ink Block complex features a Whole Foods, a luxury condo building, and 315 apartments renting for up to $6,000 a month. The Ink Block developer just launched sales at Siena, with condos selling for as much as $2 million.

Behind Quinzani’s, the new Troy Boston apartment building, with gas fireplaces and leather couches in the lobby, is largely full. And more projects are in the works, including an 11-story office and retail building and a 602-unit apartment building.

All these changes don’t concern Bob Wells, a member of the Old Dover Neighborhood Association and a resident since 1992. Wells, 72, has seen the area evolve from a land of “weeds and drug dealers” into a thriving neighborhood with galleries, markets, and, best of all, people.

“Things are going to develop, that’s good, as long as they develop in the right direction,” he said.

Pedestrians wakled by Quinzani's Bakery.

Quinzani’s first opened as a pastry shop in theold Combat Zone downtown and moved to its current location at 380 Harrison Ave. about 50 years ago. The business grew from one horse-drawn delivery wagon to a fleet of trucks operating on five delivery routes around Greater Boston and 30 independent distributors covering New England, according to its website.

The wholesaler serves 800 clients in all, including caterers, delis, restaurants, and food service companies.

Quinzani’s may have even been responsible for a once-common tradition at local Chinese restaurants: serving dinner rolls with the meals. In the mid 1990s, the Globe reported that more than 200 Chinese restaurant owners from as far away as Tewksbury descended on Quinzani’s every morning to pick up baguettes and rolls. According to the story, the relationship started when the Quinzani brothers opened a pastry shop on LaGrange Street and convinced Chinese restaurant owners nearby that they should serve bread in their restaurants — an American staple that would make diners more comfortable.

Calise & Sons Bakery of Lincoln, R.I., will take over Quinzani’s business and will make most of the bakery’s products in conjunction with Piantedosi Baking Co. in Malden.

Blunch, the South End spot that serves pressed sandwiches with gourmet ingredients such as goat cheese and basil cashew pesto, has been serving Quinzani’s bread for seven years. Owner Nikki Christo Leo said she will miss not only the Quinzani family, but their proximity. “When I run out of bread mid-rush, they won’t be down the street for me to go and retrieve it.”

For Quinzani’s workers, however, the transition will be more difficult.

Tan Guan, 61, has worked at the bakery for 15 years, the last four as a baker on the night shift making $13.89 an hour, with paid holidays and three weeks of vacation. Guan is getting a severance package, a half-week of pay for every year of service, but is worried about finding a new job.

“It’s going to be really hard for me to look for work,” he said in Chinese through a translator on Friday. “I’m over 60 years old.”

The Quinzanis said in a statement that they are working with the state office of Labor and Workforce Development to help find work for their “loyal and assiduous employees.”

“We’re doing the best we can do for them,” said Rob-Roy Quinzani, who co-owns the business with his brother Stephen and cousin Larry.

Quinzani declined to comment on how the bakery’s closing fits into the changing face of the neighborhood. “I don’t want to look like I’m selling out and walking away,” he said.

This lake was my favourite part of this exhibition, in which artists have given their take on the gallery's architecture. I found myself calculating the weight of the water, and the structural strength that would be needed to support it.

From an engineering point of view, there wasn't anything in Psycho Buildings that worried me. All the artists display a pretty good understanding of how things are supposed to stand up, from a straightforward timber skeleton clothed in Lycra, to the geodesic dome on the roof. I had a good look at Los Carpinteros' exploding room: I wanted to make sure that the opening in the wall where the explosion was supposed to have happened was properly supported. There was a lintel in there, so that was all right.

What struck me most was the interaction between the creative and the mathematical. Each of the 11 pieces was an interface between structural engineering, architecture and art, but the edges were blurred. Overall, the show wasn't what I expected from the ads - I was wondering whether they had made some radical change to the Hayward itself, something like the giant concrete horn you see on the posters. (That particular one would have been tricky: if you could build it light enough for the building to support, the wind would probably blow it away.)

Most thought-provoking was Do Ho Suh's sculpture of a Korean house embedded in an American one. The light, open transparency of the Korean style crashes into the more solid privacy of the American. It goes against my sense of order. It's a disturbing image for me.

But with Valencia's new opera house, the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía, perhaps we should be talking about a Gaudí effect. It's a flashy new culture palace all right, designed by one of the world's premier league ""starchitects"", Santiago Calatrava, and it could well do for Spain's third city what Frank Gehry's Guggenheim did for Bilbao. But there are some key differences. First and foremost, Valencia is Calatrava's home town. He was born there, grew up there, studied there and even published a book on the city's architecture. And although his office is based in Zurich, Calatrava has been building in Valencia for most of his career. So just as Antoni Gaudí's curvaceous architecture has become synonymous with Barcelona, so Calatrava's could become one of Valencia's selling points.

The softly spoken 54-year-old is already something of a local hero, having risen to global prominence with projects like the Olympic stadium in Athens. His Alameda Bridge, crossing the bed of Valencia's dried-up Turia River, has been unofficially renamed ""Calatrava Bridge"" - it even appears as such on maps. But the architect's main preoccupation has been the City of Arts and Sciences, a vast, futuristic complex to the southeast. Conceived, by the regional government as a one-stop project to boost Valencia's profile, the 35-hectare park incorporates a science museum, a planetarium and other attractions, surrounded by pools and parks, and it was almost entirely designed by Calatrava. He has spent the past 15 years on it, and the Palau de les Arts, eight years in the making, is the piece de resistance - less his Guggenheim than his Sagrada Família.

Unlike Gaudí's overreaching cathedral, Calatrava has at least completed his grand plan. The Palau de les Arts unveiled itself to the world last October, with fireworks, royalty and an inaugural concert series, not to mention Calatrava himself, who declared that the €250m building was ""on a scale with the cultural ambitions of the people of Valencia"". It is one of the biggest performing arts centres in Europe. The architect has described it in nautical terms, alluding to the dried-up riverbed and the sea nearby, but it looks more like a gigantic Trojan helmet, or perhaps something Darth Vader might wear to a nightclub.

When it comes to Calatrava's style, again, Gaudí is a fitting comparison. Both architects have been labelled ""organic"", which means to say their work is short on straight lines and right angles, but both were less interested in imitating natural forms than divining their essential structures. Just as Gaudí worked out the curves of his buildings by making models in chains and hanging them upside down, so Calatrava takes his cues from horses' spines or the human body, and tests his ideas with sculptures as much as sketches.

In Calatrava's case, the result has been a unique architectural vocabulary that can only be described in terms of natural forms such as leaves, trees, animal skeletons, and birds. Full of soaring cantilevers, cavernous, uninterrupted chambers and elegantly tapered ribs and columns, Calatrava's buildings show off a great deal - hence his suitability for icon-making. And rather than clutter up his pure structures with cladding, he prefers to leave them bare, as unclothed demonstrations of his virtuosity. He seldom uses any materials other than steel, glass and concrete, and the colour of choice is white, with black or grey as a second option. Where Gaudí's buildings were warm and sensuous, Calatrava's are closer to the cool abstraction of Mies van der Rohe.

It is no understatement to call Calatrava a genius, but is he a genius of architecture? If there's a drawback to Calatrava's brilliance, it is that he thinks like a mathematician (his PhD thesis was on ""the foldability of space frames""). There is often the suspicion with his work that the ingenious sculptural form came first and the job of fitting in actual people happened later. Unsurprisingly, his first major successes were bridges. The Alameda (or Calatrava) Bridge in Valencia, completed in 1995, is a classic example - a 130m span supported by a simple, flat bow along its middle that unexpectedly leans over at an angle to the vertical. The lean is to counterbalance the asymmetrical loading: there is a road on one side and a pedestrian path on the other. It simultaneously looks like something that shouldn't stay up and something that's impossible to refine any further.

From bridges, Calatrava graduated to transport infrastructure like train stations and airports (such as Bilbao), where his elegantly engineered forms fitted perfectly. But in recent years he's been struggling to expand his repertoire. The big commissions are still coming in - such as the train station at New York's World Trade Centre site, or a skyscraper in Chicago that will be the tallest building in the US - but so is the bad press. The last-minute completion of his ambitious Athens Olympic stadium was as tense a race as any that took place inside it. And his first project in the US, the extension to the Milwaukee Art Museum, spiralled over budget catastrophically.

To add to his woes, critics have begun to dismiss Calatrava's style as ""kitsch"" and to find his metaphors glib and unsuited to complex architectural statements. In this respect, Valencia's City of Arts and Sciences lays bare the architect's strengths and weakness like a biography. The simplest building is a trademark Calatrava promenade of minimal parabolic arches joined by leaf-like struts. Across a string of turquoise pools is the science museum - a vast hall resembling a dinosaur skeleton - and L'Hemisfèric, a regular dome covered by an elongated shell containing a planetarium and an Imax cinema. Reflected in the surrounding pools, L'Hemisfèric resembles an eye. Its sides even open up mechanically like an eyelid, albeit one dissected by the waterline. It's all startling, space-age stuff, but with its cold bleached bones, vast scale and relentless symmetry, this Calatravan monoculture can start to feel a little alienating.

The Palau de les Arts, though, is like a sigh of relief. It might not be as instantly iconic as his purer structures, but it's a good deal more inviting. The curved concrete plates on the outside are clad in white trencadís, that traditional mosaic of broken tiles so famously employed by Gaudí. There's even some blue in there, and some softening roof gardens. It looks like Calatrava is loosening up, and if there's a slight dad-on-the-dancefloor awkwardness - the ""nautical"" portholes along its flanks, or the giant mohican canopy, which smacks of dazzling engineering for its own sake - the Palau is still an extraordinary building.

Swathes of swirling white concrete channel the visitor through a procession of surprising, intriguing spaces, offering sudden views up to the sky or across the city. In the auditoria themselves, Calatrava's simplicity pays off, and simple wooden slats and coloured leather seats add touches of warmth. Even the architect's penchant for moving parts pays off: in the main theatre hall, the ceiling is made up of elongated light boxes that slide down to form a hi-tech curtain over the stage - nothing that will detract from the performances but a memorable piece of showmanship all the same. Calatrava has also opened up most parts of the building to the public, as part of a pedestrian route that connects two previously separate areas of the city.

It might not be his masterpiece but perhaps the Palau marks the beginning of a new phase in Calatrava's work, and a concerted attempt to correct his perceived weaknesses. Even if he retired tomorrow, his legacy is assured, but Calatrava still has plenty of time to develop. He has opened up previously uncharted realms of space and structure, and it remains to be seen whether anyone can fully exploit them, most of all Calatrava himself.",Santiago Calatrava's stunning buildings for Valencia bear comparison with the work of another great Spanish architect.

My wife and I had recently retired and I chanced upon this building on the internet. I remember calling my wife over and saying: ""Look, it's a shed in a field.""

The place was called ""Cobtun"" – ""cob"" is a primitive but strong building material made of clay, straw, water and earth, and ""tun"" is the old Saxon word for a dwelling. It was built in 2001 by Birmingham's Associated Architects. The design brief was just nine words long: ""Humour, mystery, fantasy, ecological, sustainable, independent, contextual, agricultural, invisible.""

The cob wall is 2ft thick and 15ft high, and it has been designed to look even thicker than that. I think the original name for it was ""Mycenaean wall"", and there's definitely something of a buttress to it. It curves around the house, encloses the flower garden and even makes up some of the inside walls. One of the bedrooms has an earth wall, which is surprisingly nice to the touch: very hard, very tactile; a bit like a piece of Japanese pottery. It doesn't smell, and apart from a couple of spiders, we haven't had any surprise visitors. The rest of the house is very modern: lots of oak-clad timber with a crisp finish.

It definitely has a cheeky sense of humour. Rather unusually, it's a house with 25 sides – and that excludes the annex outside. We had an old corner cabinet that we wanted to bring into our new home, but we soon realised that there was only one 90-degree corner in the whole house.

Cobtun won the 2005 Riba sustainability award. The oak is from Hertfordshire, the wall is made with mud from the meadow, and the cob's stone footing was sourced from the Forest of Dean. The roof is made of corrugated aluminium, with solar tubes for heating water on top. There are lots of dark concrete surfaces inside the house, which store heat from the sun and save us using the radiators. There's a utility room within the cob wall with pulleys for drying clothes – the cob absorbs the moisture in the atmosphere, so there's no need for a tumble dryer. I'd be lying if I said I used to care much about being energy efficient. But this house has changed the way we think.",Life in a cob eco cabin,78.5,0.5,0.8333333333,high,low,abstractive,architecture

In a bathroom of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Athletic Center, the fashion designer Ronaldus Shamask explained to his models how to stand very still. In a back locker room, Issey Miyake's assistant gave his models some last-minute instructions in tai chi. And in an adjoining locker room, Gianfranco Ferre, satisfied with his models, helped Mariuccia Mandelli of Krizia and rolled his eyes.

The occasion was M.I.T.'s first exhibition of fashion as a serious design discipline, attended by over 1,000 Bostonians and other visitors Friday night, and it was an unprecedented three-ring success. Entitled ''Intimate Architecture: Contemporary Clothing Design,'' the exhibition was mounted at M.I.T.'s Hayden Gallery by the curator Susan Sidlauskas and was followed by a fashion show staged by the Fashion Group of Boston.

Both presented the work of eight designers who are part of a growing international fraternity informally known as the architects of fashion. All are joined by a similar design vocabulary: a propensity for minimalist designs and cerebral tailoring and an aversion to surface decoration. Although Giorgio Armani and Claude Montana did not show up, the other leading members of the fraternity did: Mr. Ferre, Miss Mandelli, Mr. Shamask, Issey Miyake, Yeohlee Teng and Stephen Manniello, the only American-born designer there.

Also in attendance was a contingent of New Yorkers including the fashion designers Gloria Sachs, Pinky Wolman and Dianne Beaudry; Robert Mapplethorpe, who photographed the clothes for the exhibit's catalogue, and such retailers as Ira Neimark and Dawn Mello of Bergdorf Goodman. In addition, there was a flotilla of fashion followers who came from as far away as Beverly Hills, Calif.

''The exhibit,'' said Mr. Miyake, ''proves that fashion no longer has to be separated from the other design fields. At its best, it is considerably more than a craft. It must represent its time. That M.I.T. has staged this show validates fashion and may inspire students here not to become electrical engineers but engineers of fashion.''

For the public, the exhibition began at 5 P.M. at the Hayden, and viewers arrived wearing everything from gym shorts to cutaways to pink satin and diamond earrings. Designed by Daniel Pike, the Hayden exhibition shows the clothing without benefit of traditional mannequins. Instead, plaster casts of body parts have been suspended from the ceiling and the clothing draped on them. In the Krizia exhibit, a cast plastic bra and bathing suit bottom hung on a torso. In the Ferre exhibit, a black and white leather Mae West jacket hung serenely next to a Ferre white pique dress, itself a little marvel of fashion engineering. The Miyake exhibit was an explosion of rattan and polyurethane breastplates floating over silk skirts.

For those who live in Boston, the exhibition was not only an opportunity to wear clothes that might look a little strange on the Boston Common but a signal that fashion had finally arrived in the heart of academia. ''The show,'' said Kate Hines, a jewelry designer in a Daniel Hechter black tuxedo, ''is the most refreshing thing anyone affiliated with fashion will ever see. To have fashion at M.I.T. means those of us involved with it in Boston do not have to have a complex about it.''

Some of the designers who had verbalized misgivings about the show during the fittings at the Athletic Center came away from the Hayden suprisingly sanguine about it all. ''My God,'' said Miss Mandelli, ''my clothing really does look like sculpture.''

At 9 P.M., the guests left the exhibition to walk under the trees to the Athletic Center, which in the winter houses a hockey rink but which Friday night was filled with tables, a dance floor, black and white balloons and eight platforms placed along the length of one wall. Paper Cape and Monks' Coats

As the fashion show began, the models came out at intervals. Krizia's woolen coats with hip belts were first, followed by Mr. Miyake's paper cape over a skirt and tunic, and Mr. Shamask's hooded monks' coats. But the lights did not function. The music tape sagged. After some backstage maneuvering, it all fell into place, and as a model wearing a Miyake molded rubber jacket flexed an arm, as Ferre's models wearing his black velvet and leather trousers, tops and ties stepped out, the crowd left the tables, sat cross-legged in their taffeta on the dance floor and applauded.

When it was over, each designer, surrounded by his models, was introduced separately to the audience. All that was missing was an applause meter to gauge who had won.

Sir John Soane's Museum is curious and secret. If you were to walk past it casually you wouldn't know that inside it was a labyrinthine cave, a mysterious cabinet of curiosities. When the architect and collector John Soane died in 1837, the building and its contents was preserved by act of parliament for the nation. It forms a transition between a magpie-like private collection and a public museum.

What makes this building important for modern architects is its sense of space and light. Soane used light to pull the energy of the rooms to their edges. For instance, he built skylights, and sometimes skylights within skylights, in the subdivisions between the rooms; and the breakfast room has a domed roof that doesn't quite touch the walls, allowing light to drop down at the sides. Meanwhile, the collections of objects on the walls of the room make these edges even more energetic and interesting.

There's another thing I really like: when you look out from the first floor on to the extended roof of the ground floor you can see the little skylights and glass domes poking up like architectural vegetables in an allotment. It's just wonderful.

Decent architects have been employed at Heathrow, but the overall effect of the airport is one of total visual chaos. There's nothing more dispiriting and embarrassing than arriving here; everything seems to have been built cheaply and filled to the brim with glitzy, nightmarish shops. This commercial free-for-all gives it a sort of early Thatcherite feel. Even really well-designed airports like Stansted have also been wrecked by the clutter of shops and hideous half-timbered pubs. As a first impression of Britain it's an utter disgrace.

The Empire State Building. Photograph: Felix Clay

Which is the world's most famous modern building? I have a strong suspicion that a global poll might well choose the Empire State Building. It's not just that the soaring Art Deco skyscraper was for decades the tallest structure on Earth, or that it has featured in countless photographs, newsreels and feature films (including, of course King Kong). It was, and remains, a magnificent successor to a line of monumentally aspiring buildings that takes us back to the very first great works of architecture.

In a sense, this hugely popular New York landmark, the architectural pivot around which Manhattan appears to turn, is a 20th-century successor to the ancient ziggurats that arose in Sumeria, between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and marked the beginning of western civilisation and the city itself. Like those haunting brick structures, the Empire State Building, all steel, glass and granite, stretches up from the street, and our reach, to the heavens. Its reach, lit up beautifully at night, seems all but infinite. It is also a confidently realised and remarkably well-mannered conceit, and one that nearly eighty years after its completion attracts queues of visitors from around the world to ride its elevators and bestride its public viewing platforms. ""Look at me, Ma!"", it's hard not to think as your eyes command panoramas of Manhattan, and beyond, ""I'm on top of the world.""

When we decided to choose the world's top twelve modern buildings to publish as pull-outs from the Guardian and as interactive online guides, we had to be ruthless and partisan. We also wanted to show a spread of different types of buildings, from houses to places of work, enlightenment and worship, and to revel in the extraordinary range of styles that architecture has adopted worldwide since 1900.

I don't think our Magnificent Dozen could ever have excluded Sydney Opera House. Like the Empire State Building, Jorn Utzon's stirring design is the defining building of the city it rises from. In fact, Sydney Opera house redefined the way we saw and thought about its host city. Daring, complex, playful and superbly sited, here is one of those buildings visitors are drawn to as if magnetically.

Sydney Opera House spawned Frank Gehry's sensational Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. Clad in titanium, this architectural waltz shimmers at every gridded street junction as you walk from the docks to the old heart of the Basque capital. Critics say that the Guggenheim is not 100 per cent practical for staging exhibitions. But here, for better or worse, the building is the star: the Bilbao Guggenheim is a glorious exhibition of itself, an architectural gesture, and urban eye-catcher that has truly transformed the way the world sees Bilbao and Bilbao sees itself.

The Pompidou Centre did something of the same for Paris. It made the city seem instantly modern. Truly revolutionary, this architectural coup de theâtre remains a surprise to look at and, celebrating its thirtieth birthday this year, is more popular than ever.

One of the most numinous of all modern places of worship of whatever creed is the pilgrimage chapel designed by Le Corbusier, set on a hilltop at Ronchamp in the Haute-Saone. This had to be on our list. So, too, Daniel Libeskind's haunting Jewish Museum in Berlin, a building that was most effective when newly complete and empty. During the lull between the museum's completion and the installation of a permanent exhibition inside its zig-zag, zinc-clad walls, people from all over the world queued to tour the empty shell. Theirs was a deeply moving experience in the grip of this powerful modern labyrinth.

We had to have a building by Frank Lloyd Wright, the greatest US architect of the last hundred years, and what Modern house is more compelling than Fallingwater? Foster's 30 St Mary Axe, or the ""Gherkin"", is one of the most charismatic of contemporary city towers. Gaudi's Casa Mila in Barcelona remains a city block like no other, a magnificent example of seemingly willful organic design that, nevertheless, fits beautifully into the streetscape of the great Catalan city. Grimshaw's Eden Centre, rising like a sea of bubbles from old Cornish chalk pits, is a dazzling example of lightweight hi-tech design, and yet another ultra-modern building that had done much to revive the fortunes of its locale. Zaha Hadid's Phaeno Science Centre in Wolfsburg is a sci-fi blast, a wonderfully confident structure in which floors become walls, walls become floors and the world suddenly seems like a movie-set come to life, and very enjoyably so.

That's eleven. Our twelfth, which is very much mine, is nothing more and nothing less than a London Underground tube station. Arnos Grove, designed by Charles Holden for Frank Pick, chief executive of the London Passenger Transport Board, is a truly ennobling, if modest public building. Look at it afresh. Here is a utilitarian construction that is, nevertheless a Roman civic temple brought up-to-date, a knowing reference to some of the greatest European public buildings of its era - most notably Gunnar Asplund's Stockholm City Library - as well as a superbly functional railway station and, above all, a work of civic art that lifts the mundane into a noble architectural spirit. Some tube station. I wonder if commuters using it day-to-day feel the same way?

Arnos Grove station is not exactly the Empire State Building, and yet I like to think that Manhattan's magnificent tower would look down very respectfully at a work of architecture that, too, was designed not simply to please a wealthy elite, but as a modern fanfare for the common man.

Here, Al Jazeera profiles three Palestinian families who have been impacted by the occupation in very different ways.

A story in three chapters

Dawn was just breaking when Israeli forces began to smash the walls of Mohammed Allyanâs home with sledgehammers.

Mohammed stood outside in the chill winter air and watched as the house that had given shelter to generations of his family came apart, piece by piece. Doors were ripped off their hinges; walls broke into jagged holes. The small balcony, where Mohammed liked to sit with his coffee each morning and listen to the birds, disappeared into rubble and dust.

The demolition order was carried out in the first week of the new year, nearly three months after Israeli forces fatally shot Mohammed's son, 22-year-old Bahaa Allyan, who was accused in a deadly shooting and stabbing attack on a bus in the East Talpiot Jewish settlement last October.

""The first thing I said was that stone is not more valuable than the soul,"" said Mohammed, a 60-year-old lawyer with gentle eyes. He spoke with Al Jazeera from outside the tent where his family now lives, next to the smashed remains of their home in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Jabal Mukaber.

""I also realised that the way they were demolishing the house seemed vengeful. They were trying to do it in a vengeful way,"" Mohammed said, shifting his gaze from the wreckage towards the tent, empty of all but a few thin mattresses and a Palestinian flag.

""I was losing a place that we grew up in, a place that was home â¦ [but it was] nothing compared to losing my son.""

Dawn was just breaking when...

A poster of Bahaa Allyan hangs in the ruins of his family's home.

For decades, Israeli security forces have used punitive home demolitions as a tool against the Palestinian population. Because the practice deliberately punishes civilians who are living under occupation and have broken no laws, Human Rights Watch has deemed it a war crime.

Although the stated goal of punitive demolitions is to boost security by deterring future violence, research has not borne out this argument. In 2005, an Israeli military committee called for an end to the practice, suggesting that it might actually be fuelling unrest.

âTo face the death of a child is a bitter thingâ

A temporary lull in punitive demolitions followed the 2005 order, but the policy picked up again in the summer of 2014, after the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the occupied West Bank. Since then, more than two dozen Palestinian homes have been demolished as a punitive measure, while hundreds more have been razed for other reasons, including the lack of a building permit.

""We view [punitive demolitions] as a form of collective punishment, which is used against innocent people - family members of Palestinians who have perpetrated horrific attacks against Israelis, but most of whom are either dead or under arrest and expecting very long prison sentences,"" Sarit Michaeli, a spokesperson for the Jerusalem-based human rights organisation B'Tselem, told Al Jazeera.

What do you remember the most about your home?

""It's a deliberate policy of harming innocent people for the actions of others â¦ In some cases, the measures the authorities use to demolish the homes also harm neighbouring homes, which arenât even inhabited by anyone related to the perpetrator,â she said.

Mohammed Allyan says Israeli forces demolished his home in a 'vengeful' fashion.

Although families whose homes are targeted for demolition can appeal to halt the order through the Israeli courts, such remedies are almost never granted, Michaeli added.

Al Jazeera asked Israelâs defence ministry to provide information on the stateâs strategy of demolishing the homes of suspected attackers, including what process was used to determine the qualifying homes and what evidence existed to show that the strategy worked. Despite numerous emails and phone calls, the ministry did not provide a response.

In some cases, homes targeted for demolition are razed to the ground, while others are sealed with cement or smashed until they no longer provide shelter - as was the case for Mohammed Allyan.

His house, located on the middle storey of a short apartment complex, has now been reduced to a jumble of concrete rubble and hanging wires, with only the buildingâs structural support beams intact. The demolition order was issued in November, and after two appeals failed, it was carried out on January 4.

The walls of the family's home were smashed with sledgehammers.

Posters commemorating Bahaa have been hung in the ruins, where Mohammedâs grandchildren flit in and out. Black butterflies are painted on what is left of the walls.

Yet Mohammed and his family have still not fully grieved their loss, because Israeli authorities have withheld Bahaaâs body, along with the bodies of nine other Palestinians killed since the latest round of violence broke out in October. âTo face the death of a child is a bitter thing,â Mohammed remarked. âWhat is even bitterer is the state of waiting to face the truth.â

Less than a year before he died, in December 2014, Bahaa wrote a Facebook post titled âThe 10 commandments of a martyrâ. In it, he acknowledged that home demolition was a likely consequence of âmartyrdomâ, and noted: âDo not make me a number you will remember today and forget tomorrow.â

The title of âmartyrâ, however, is not the part Mohammed wants to remember about his son.

âLike any Palestinian young man, [Bahaa] used to dream of freedomâ

Bahaa was an avid reader, a Scout leader, and a youth support worker. Two years ago, he gathered thousands of people together to create a human chain around the Old City; each person carried a book, all of which were later gathered for a library. It was a message to the Israelis, his father said: âWe are not who you say we are. We are not terrorists. We are educated people. We are well-read people.â

Mohammed cleared his throat and looked out across the horizon, as the afternoon sun began to sink lower in the darkening sky.

âLike any Palestinian young man, [Bahaa] used to dream of freedom,â Mohammed said quietly. âHe had a lot of hopes and dreams, and he hoped for freedom, but the reality of the occupation â¦ led him to try to find a way to resist, and this was the path he chose.â

I do not hear the singing of the birds

Nor the cooing of the dove

Or the rustling of the trees, and we

As if the birds and the trees

Left the morning in protest

Because of the mayhem of people.

If humans had the heart of a dove

If they had the shade of a tree

You would not be now lying in the frost

The morning would not be without beauty

And we would only hear the mayhem of humans.

Every morning, Osama al-Seikh asked himself whether he would come back home from work alive.

Around sunrise, the 39-year-old would leave his wife and four daughters in their modest home in Dura in the southern West Bank governorate of Hebron. After a half-hour trip to the Gush Etzion Jewish settlement, he would pass through a series of security checks, including a metal detector, before on-site guards allowed him to begin work. His job was to lay foundations for settler homes.

Late last year, as violence escalated in Israel and the occupied West Bank, Seikh and his colleagues began noticing more checkpoints on the way to work. The on-site security inspections became more intensive, while the verbal abuse from settlers soared, he said.

âThey would curse at us; they would curse our mothers. They would say, âArabs are not even safe in the grave,ââ Seikh told Al Jazeera, clad in a brown corduroy vest and a keffiyeh, his eyes burning. âYounger children would throw stones.â

Every morning, Osama al-Seikh asked...

Yassine Hisham, left, and Osama al-Seikh have both helped build Israeli settlements.

Although settlers had security teams to protect them, âI had nothingâ, Seikh added.

âEvery morning when I left my house, I didnât know whether I would come back alive or dead. It was like I had a going-away party for myself every morning,â he said. âI was risking my life to go and make 200 shekels [$50] a day to feed my family.â

Many Palestinians have been driven towards this type of work, facing a total unemployment rate of around 25 percent in the Palestinian territories, including the besieged Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank. According to the International Labour Organization, âthe combined weight of the continued occupation and the settlements does not permit the development of a viable, productive Palestinian economy â¦ [and] if current trends continue, the scope for such opportunities will shrink furtherâ.

Why do Palestinians work in Israeli settlements?

Approximately 58,000 Palestinians hold a permit to work in Israel, while an additional 27,000 work in Israeli settlements, according to the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. Of those who work in settlements, more than half do construction.

Construction work is ongoing at this settlement in occupied East Jerusalem.

Last month, Israel temporarily banned Palestinians from working in some settlements, citing the need for extra âsecurity measuresâ in the wake of recent attacks.

Despite the grim irony of their situation, young Palestinians are drawn to settlement construction work because they can earn two or three times as much as they would from a Palestinian employer, noted Samir Abdullah, the director of research for the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute.

âIt was like I had a going-away party for myself every morningâ

âOf course we don't want them to do it, and they don't want to do it. This is as if you are digging your own grave,â Abdullah told Al Jazeera. âThey know these settlements are on their lands, and they are impeding Palestinian statehood and freedom. They are building their own prison - a system that will kick them out of their own country. Everyone who is there is doing so because it's the only way to get bread for their kids â¦ There is no ability to give them an alternative.""

Abeer Odeh, the Palestinian economy minister, acknowledged the lack of alternatives, noting that when young Palestinians find any opportunities, âthey take them because they want to surviveâ.

Odeh said she was hopeful that the situation would improve within the next few years, citing a strategy by the Palestinian Authority (PA) to bolster local industry by increasing exports by two-thirds over the next five years. The PA has also been working to attract new investors in areas such as agriculture, stone and marble, and tourism, she said.

What are the obstacles to finding work in the West Bank?

âWe are doing our best to facilitate and create jobs for [Palestinians],"" Odeh said.

But such words ring hollow to Seikh and his friends, including Yassine Hisham, 23, who once worked in settlement construction but is now unemployed. Hisham, whose father passed away when he was a baby and whose mother has taken ill, says he has lost faith that anything will change.

As a Palestinian, building Israeli settlements âfeels awful, but I never had any alternativeâ, Hisham told Al Jazeera, perched on a dark, floral-printed couch inside Seikhâs family home. His eyes distant, Hisham acknowledged that his dreams for a better future died long ago: âWhat am I supposed to do?â

âWhat I wish for the most is to be able to finish schoolâ

For his part, Seikh stopped working in settlement construction late last year, as the anxiety of his daily trip to work began to exact its toll. While he can earn more than 200 shekels a day building settlements - compared to 60 to 80 shekels a day for similar work in Hebron - Seikh says he will work locally for the time being, simply because it is safer.

As he spoke, Seikhâs 63-year-old father, Rasmi, listened from an armchair across the room, occasionally nodding his head in agreement.

âWe shouldnât work in settlements,â Rasmi said. âThe Israelis stole and built on Palestinian land. They try to make the younger generation forget their connection to the land. But the problem is, thereâs no alternative.â

Still, Osama al-Seikh holds onto the hope that his days of building settler homes are behind him.

âWhat I wish for the most is to be able to finish school,â he said. âI left in ninth grade; I couldnât keep going when my parents didnât have enough food to eat.

âI just want us to live with dignity and freedom.â

Pisgat Zeev settlement,occupied East Jerusalem

For the past decade, Kiffayah Khatibâs home has felt like her prison.

Once considered a part of the Palestinian village of Hizma, the 70-year-oldâs small, unassuming house has now been swallowed into the boundaries of Pisgat Zeev, a Jewish settlement built among the rolling hills of occupied East Jerusalem. After Israelâs separation wall cut through the village of Hizma a decade ago, Khatibâs home ended up on the âIsraeli sideâ, in what is known as the seam zone - land that is east of the Green Line but west of the wall.

Unlike their cousins up the street whose land was annexed after the 1967 war, Khatib and her family were never issued with Jerusalem ID cards, and instead still hold their West Bank IDs. As a consequence, ""We are not allowed anywhere [in Jerusalem] other than in this house,â Khatib, 70, told Al Jazeera from inside the familyâs sun-filled living room.

âOnce we cross the checkpoint [from Hizma], this is the only place where we are legally allowed,â Khatib added, gazing out the window with cloudy eyes, while resting her gnarled fingers on the lap of her royal blue dress. âIf we visited our relatives up the road, we would be arrested.""

For the past decade, Kiffayah Khatibâs home...

Khairi Askar has been battling in court for decades to protect his land.

The familyâs circumstances are a peculiar consequence of Israelâs separation wall, a barrier that has been under construction since 2002 and, upon completion, is meant to stretch for more than 700km. Parts of the wall follow the Green Line, but much of it lies inside the West Bank, annexing Palestinian land.

When the wall cut through Hizma, Khatibâs family was stranded on the âIsraeli sideâ - unable to move freely around Jerusalem because they are technically still West Bankers, but also unable to visit their old friends, go shopping or spend time in Hizma without crossing through an Israeli checkpoint.

The familyâs situation is by no means unique, noted Dror Etkes, an expert on land and settlement policy in the West Bank.

âIf we visited our relatives up the road, we would be arrestedâ

âThere are many thousands of people who are living in an area where they need a special permit from Israeli authorities in order to be in their homes,â Etkes told Al Jazeera, noting access to municipal services in seam zones is frequently lacking. â[All aspects of] everyday life, the ability to run your life on a normal basis, to help guests â¦ to go in and out whenever you want - all these things are very complicated, and the smaller and more isolated the family and the community is, the harder it is.â

In response to questions from Al Jazeera about the efficacy of the separation wall and about claims that it has exacerbated divisions between Israelis and Palestinians, Israelâs defence ministry maintained the structure was a legitimate form of defence against âindiscriminate terrorâ.

âIsraelâs government recognises that the construction of the security fence can introduce hardship into the lives of Palestinians and Israelis and it regrets those hardships,â the ministry said in a written statement, noting that âall attempts to minimise such problems have been madeâ. Less than one percent of the West Bank Palestinian population will end up on the Israeli side of the wall, the ministry noted.

Kiffayah Khatib, left, and her daughter Umm Kalthoum say the wall has severed their connection to their old community in Hizma.

Back in Pisgat Zeev, Khatibâs cousin, Khairi Askar, has been battling in court for decades to protect his land, located just a few hundred metres down the road from Khatib. Israel annexed Askarâs land into the boundaries of Jerusalem in the wake of the 1967 war, and has prevented his family from expanding beyond their two small apartment complexes, which together house dozens of family members, said Askar, a 74-year-old retired father of 10.

The separation wall has compounded their difficulties, severing their connection to their old community in Hizma, Askar told Al Jazeera. Holding a cigarette in one weathered hand, he gazed out across his back porch towards the adjacent Jewish settlement, whose red brick pavement abruptly ends at his property line - replaced by grey, cracked concrete.

How has Israel's separation wall affected your family?

âWhen there are funerals or weddings, no one can come here to celebrate or mourn with us,â he said, slumping slightly in his chair, his thin jacket open in the warm winter air. âItâs as if we are in two separate countries.â

But Askar says he will never retreat to the West Bank: âThere is nothing more important than my land and my home. This is where I belong. I donât want to live anywhere else.â

The Jewish settlement of Pisgat Zeev is located in occupied East Jerusalem.

Khatib, who lives with about two dozen family members, is also determined to remain in place, despite the daily hardships that affect all facets of their life. For years, their home was not connected to Jerusalemâs municipal water supply, and they still lack access to sewage services and rubbish pick-up. They cannot go into Jerusalem to shop, yet there are restrictions on the types of products they can bring home from the West Bank: âEggs, chicken and meat give us problems; it all depends on the mood of the officer at the checkpoint.â

Medical care is also a challenge, as the family must cross into the West Bank for hospital visits - a daunting prospect for Khatibâs two daughters, who suffer from ataxia, a neurological disorder that affects muscle movement.

What has changed for you since Israel built the separation wall?

Khatib squinted as she glanced onto her back porch, where a laundry line swayed gently in the afternoon breeze. Her adult daughters, Umm Kalthoum and Khitam Khatib, sat listlessly in wheelchairs, their faces distant and drained.

âSince they erected the wall, we've been suffering â¦ and if I didn't have grandkids [to help out], I'd be in a lot of trouble,â Kiffayah Khatib said. âIf I have to take my daughter to the bathroom and she falls, I can't pick her up. No one can visit me; no one can help me.",Al Jazeera profiles three Palestinian families who have been impacted by the Israeli occupation in very different ways.,196.5789473684,1.0,9.5263157895,high,high,extractive,architecture

I've been here more than a half dozen times over the years.

With about seven months to go until the World Cup, I've come back again, spending the past five days searching for any signs the city is ready to host footballs biggest event.

The minute you land at Marechal Rondon airport you're greeted by construction. The good news: the airport is undergoing an expansion to triple its capacity.

The bad news: the work is less than 50 percent complete.

The airport is ripped to shreds; the new car park is still dirt, and the new terminal has a structural framing but not much else.

I'm sure it will be beautiful when it's done - in March, builders insist.

Right now it resembles more of a rural, roadside bus stop still under construction, and a dusty one at that.

When I ask a woman what she thinks of it all, her response was one word: ""Bagunça"", meaning confusion and disorder.

After you manoeuvre your way out of the airport, it gets worse.

The main road leading into the city is ripped up and being expanded for the World Cup.

A poorly marked detour of cones that have been smashed by cars leads motorists through a gravel side road that snakes through a pothole-filled residential district.

Without a GPS, you are lost.

An all-you-can-eat restaurant next to the airport has boarded up and has a sign out the front which says: ""We're closed. Will re-open when the road is open again.""

Nobody knows exactly when that might be.

Many other main avenues and side streets in the city are also torn up and impassable as they build a light rail line through the city, one of the benchmark city projects of the World Cup.

On the day I arrived, the first new light rail cars arrived from Spain.

With much fanfare they were driven on a flatbed truck to the maintenance area, where I was told they would be loaded on tracks and switched on for a test.

It was trumpeted as a sign of progress.The only problem was, the tracks weren't ready.

They are planning for more than 20 kilometres of track to be built. So far as I could tell, only about 40 metres has been completed.

The governor says he expects it to be ready for the World Cup. Based on what I saw, two words come to mind: Good. Luck.

I got a sneak peak inside the Arena Pantanal, the $350m 41,000-seat stadium. The builders say it's 85 percent completed, but I toured it inside and out and I saw no pitch, no roof, no car park and no seats.

FIFA has a non-negotiable deadline that the stadiums must be delivered by December 31.

As I walked on the dirt pitch with Mauricio Guimaraes, Cuiaba's chief in charge of World Cup preparations, I asked him: ""Seems like you don't have a day to spare.""

""No, we don't have a minute to spare,"" he shot back.

Will Arena Pantanal be ready for the World Cup? Probably, but it depends how you define ""ready"", and under whose deadline.

As we left the stadium, on the outside of the construction site there was a sign that perfectly captured the conflicted mood of many Brazilians.

""Here another construction project of the World Cup,"" the sign read. Spray-painted next to it these words: ""I want education,"" in reference to the demands of the anti-World Cup protests that swept over Brazil in June.

Not to be deterred, we pushed on and stopped at a small plaza in the centre of the city where a Coca-Cola sponsored World Cup clock was erected.

But the clock was broken, and the part that was supposed to show the countdown to the days until the World Cup was blank. Perhaps an ominous sign.

We then went to film one of the major road construction projects. But it started pouring sheets of heavy rain.

As if this city didn't have enough problems, this part of Brazil is about to begin the rainy months.

When the rain starts to pour, construction zones turn into a flooded and muddy mess and work grinds to a halt. I saw it first hand. Tractors sat idle. A dozen workers huddled under trees to stay dry.

We finished our day by driving out to the suburb city of Varzea Grande. We poked around for the neighborhood of Barra do Pari. There, in some remote marshlands isolated from everything we found a sign on the side of the road that read, ""Official Training Centre, World Cup, FIFA 2014.""

Unescorted and unannounced, we drove in to take a look. There wasn't much to see.

This is supposed to be an official training site for football teams next year, but it looked less than 20 percent complete.

A man told me they had more than 100 people working on it. I stayed about 45 minutes and I counted about 25.

Nobody seemed to be doing too much work, as it was approaching 5pm and they were starting to pack up to call it a day once the clock hit 6.

There seemed little or no urgency.

On the way out, I asked a builder if he thought it would be ready for the World Cup.

""Who knows?"" he said. ""But that is our hope. But, really, only God knows.""

Based on what I saw the past few days, prayers might be all this city has left to make it in time.

Ever catch yourself saying, ""My job is a nightmare""? If so, you might mean a lot of different things. You could be dealing with an insanely annoying boss, or coworkers who are more like playground bullies, or perhaps you are forced to work in the confines of the dreaded open-plan office. In any case, these nightmarish situations are small beans compared to working in an actual nightmare, a.k.a. a haunted office building. If you know someone who works in any of these buildings, you might want to let them know it's haunted. In no particular order, here are the most haunted office buildings in America.

L.A.’s City Hall building is the hub of all activity for the state’s local government employees. The building itself was erected in 1928 and houses 32 floors of offices and meeting rooms, as well as the mayor’s office, and has long been rumored to be haunted. It also reportedly once housed a morgue. Security guards specifically claim that floors 2, 3, 4, 27, and 28 are the most haunted, saying that you can actually feel someone walking beside you. Cameras have also captured unexplainable images of human figures throughout its haunted halls.

The Empire State Building is known worldwide as the symbol of New York City. The world’s tallest building when it was built in 1931 and for 40 years afterward, the Empire State Building has known plenty of tragedy. Over 30 people have attempted suicide since its completion. One such was haunting experience involved Evelyn McHale, famously known as the “Most Beautiful Suicide.” In 1947, McHale jumped from the top of the building and met her death on top of a limousine that was parked more than 1,000 feet below the building. Today, it’s said that McHale still haunts the building, specifically the 86th floor observation deck. If you’re ever visiting and find yourself next to a woman dressed in 1940s attire and bright red lipstick, it might just be the ghost of Evelyn McHale.

This haunting takes us to Chicago, to the studio where Oprah Winfrey recorded her show. But this building’s haunted history goes back a lot farther than Harpo Productions. Back in 1915, a local company called Western Electric rounded up four charter ships to take 10,000 of its employees to Indiana for a company picnic. As soon as one ship pulled out of port, many of the 3,200 people on board rushed to the front of the ship to have a farewell view of the city. Within 15 minutes, the boat capsized, trapping hundreds underwater. Rescue workers were forced to find a makeshift morgue for the 844 dead, which included 20 complete families. That’s where Harpo Studios, then an armory, comes in. The building is still said to be haunted by the ghosts of those who drowned in the Chicago River that day. Oprah herself has reported seeing shadowy figures, dubbing one “the Grey Lady.”

Bullocks Wilshire Building – Los Angeles, CA

What was once a luxury department store back in 1929 frequented by stars like Alfred Hitchcock and John Wayne is now home to Southwestern Law School. But before it was bought and eventually renovated to be up to code and a bit more welcoming, the building went through a dark and haunting past. Rumors say that back during the 1930s, a girl fell to her death after a man pushed her off the ledge of an elevator shaft. During the renovations, security guards reported hearing a girl crying, seemingly from the elevator shaft. Visitors have also experienced lights flickering on and off on their own, window shades closing on their own, and footsteps down every hall. In the ’80s, this building was featured in the movie Ghostbusters.

On October 10, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the prime minister of Dubai, broke ground on the new building, called the Tower at Dubai Creek Harbour.

The proposed 3,045-foot building will beat the city's current record-holding skyscraper, the 2717-foot-tall Burj Khalifa, by 328 feet.

The building is designed by famed Spanish-Swiss architect Santiago Calatrava, who was also behind the World Trade Center Transportation Hub in New York and the Museum of Tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro. The tower is being built next to the Dubai Creek in Downtown Dubai, a mere six miles away from the Dubai International Airport. It will cost $1 billion to construct.

Renderings of the building show it as a minaret-like spire held down by a thick web of cables. According to Inhabitat, the building is part of the Dubai Creek Harbor development, a real estate project led by developer Emaar Properties that is expected to double the size of Dubai's downtown.

Much like the Burj Khalifa, the new tower will contain a mixture of luxury residences and commercial spaces catering to travelers and businesspeople. The building will also feature garden terraces reminiscent of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and observation decks that will encircle the building, giving a 360-degree view of the city's skyline.

To ensure the building's safety, Emaar Properties commissioned 12 wind-engineering tests and seismic studies to make sure the building will be stable under different conditions. Because the building will be the first cable-tethered structure of its height, the wind tests had to be tailored to accommodate the tower's unprecedented size and shape.

""From the materials selection to the technology used, every aspect of The Tower has been designed and developed according to the strictest international safety standards,"" Santiago Calatrava said in a statement after the ground breaking.

Emaar expects the building to be completed in 2020.

Actress Emilia Clarke has purchased a sun-drenched piece of Venice, CA, real estate to the tune of $4.64 million. And while the platinum-haired Game of Thrones Mother of Dragons would look right at home in the hipper-than-thou town, we're guessing Emilia (who's a brunette in real life) will do just fine too.

Check out the humble abode below:

Emilia Clarke buys new home in Venice

Emilia Clarke buys new home in Venice

The new Venice, CA, chapter of House Targaryen was built in 2009 and is a two-bedroom, three-bathroom spread measuring 2,817 square feet. The use of natural light was paramount in the design of the modern space — the architects at Abramson Teiger worked to bring light into every room, creating a sense of tranquillity. An elegant living room with soaring ceilings and a floor-to-ceiling bookcase seamlessly flows to the outdoor space through a wall of sliding glass doors. Outside, a lush garden, lounge area, and 30-foot swimming pool are perfect for relaxation. In the kitchen, soapstone countertops, a marble backsplash, and custom wood cabinetry create a cozy sensibility, while the center island makes preparing food easy. Upstairs, a bright and sunny master suite overlooks the garden and pool, while a spacious, custom-designed closet provides plenty of space for Emilia's growing red-carpet duds. With 80-year-old olive trees and lush landscaping, this coveted property is truly one of a kind.

When it comes to real estate, Emilia's GoT co-star Lena Headey seems to be drawn toward the same modern architectural style, though her 2014 purchase was located in the San Fernando Valley town of Sherman Oaks, CA. Either way, there are plenty of properties out there with the same chilly temperatures as Westeros or Essos. However, the commute to the Seven Kingdoms must be a killer.

Speaking at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Thursday, the Republican presidential candidate sought to pin this election as the ""last chance"" his supporters have at overthrowing the ""corrupt"" establishment — of the media, government, special interests, and corporations all working in concert.

""It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities,"" Trump told the crowd. ""For them it's a war, and for them nothing at all is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation, believe me. And this will be our last chance to save it on November 8 — remember that.""

After a 2005 tape of Trump saying obscene things about women surfaced on Friday, and multiple women accused him of unwanted, inappropriate contact on Wednesday, his campaign appeared to be unraveling. Prominent Republicans withdrew their endorsements. Polls showed his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton surging to victory.

Trump has been espousing anti-establishment rhetoric since he entered the race, but his denunciations on Thursday were spiced with a renewed vigor, seeming to galvanize and reassure his base.

In the Palm Beach speech, he suggested that the media and the banks, in particular, were working to elect the ""Clinton machine"" so that they could stay in power, and that they were behind the personal attacks lobbed against him in the last week — taking an almost apocalyptic tone.

""For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind. Our campaign represents a true existential threat like they haven't seen before,"" Trump said. ""This is not simply another four-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government.""

Some, including the head of the Anti-Defamation League, cautioned that Trump's specific attacks on the media and the banks were ""Fascist code for 'Jews',"" the New York Times reported.

Sean Sullivan with The Washington Post wrote that this belief the ""global power structure"" was out to get him fit into Trump's support for other conspiracy theories — from the President Barack Obama birther fiasco to suggesting his Republican primary opponent Ted Cruz's father was connected to John F. Kennedy's assassination.

Only 26 days and one final debate stand between the American people and a new president. As Trump said to close his speech:

""Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives finally on Nov. 8.""

CHICAGO -- It wasn't the first one.

A three-foot python, found by a resident in an 2nd floor apartment in the 6500 block of South Normal, is now in the hands of Chicago Animal Care and Control.

The woman made the discovery Monday evening in her bathroom. The ball python was wrapped around her shower curtain and on top of her medicine cabinet.

The woman's grandson says he helped retrieve another, smaller snake a few weeks ago. RELATED: Apartment residents say their building is infested with snakes

A former tenant, who lived on the building's third floor, bred snakes, against the building management company's policy of no pets allowed, the grandson says.

When the former tenant moved out, neighbor Carolyn Sims says more than a dozen dead snakes were pulled from the apartment.

A search by Animal Care and Control Tuesday morning turned up no new snakes. Still, the building's management, Eastlake Management Group, says it will bring in an pest control company to search out any snakes possibly remaining.

The Chicago Herpetological Society will take possession of the ball python for its care. It says this type of snake it harmless to humans.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is set to 'Pump' up a new TV series.

Schwarzenegger and creator Michael Konyves have just signed a deal with CBS Television Studios to develop a drama called ""Pump"" based on Schwarzenegger's Venice Beach-based bodybuilding youth, Variety has confirmed.

The former California governor/action hero spent years in Venice Beach gyms building the physique that won him multiple bodybuilding titles and catapulted him onto screens both small and big, beginning a career that transformed him from Mr. Olympia to the Terminator.

The series, which will run eight episodes, was originally sold to Showtime in 2013, and then moved to Hulu. No network is attached as of yet.

Schwarzenegger and Konyves will be joined by producers Randall Emmett and George Furla, CEOs of Emmett/Furla/Oasis, and Eric Tannenbaum, CEO of the Tannenbaum company. Bryan Goluboff, most recently of ""Blue Bloods,"" will serve as showrunner.

""The 70's were such a colorful, transformational time, for me and for our entire country,"" said Schwarzenegger. ""I look forward to bringing that color to people's living rooms with the fantastic, deep characters and the multi-layered story lines of 'Pump.'""

E/F/O also produces another CBS TV Studios effort, Starz's ""Power,"" which is set to go into production on its fourth season this fall. The Tannenbaum Company is currently in production on season 3 of ""The Odd Couple"" on CBS.

News of the deal was first reported by Deadline.

Freed from the yoke of war and perhaps inspired by Atomic Age and Space Race fervour, major electronics and appliance manufacturers went into overdrive.

The result? A blitzkrieg of advanced, more efficient products both small and large, from toasters, hand-mixers and juicers to washing machines, vacuum cleaners, cooking ranges and refrigerators. Goodbye kitchen, hello tennis courts and bridge games.

Don’t look now, but the world is in the midst of another household revolution that offers more gee-whiz technology aimed at saving time and boosting convenience in ways unimaginable just a decade ago. It is a period in which software, sensors and artificial intelligence are making it easier than ever to do everything from mow lawns and clean floors to wash windows and unlock doors.

Here are 10 of the more ingenious devices that may soon change the way we live, by making our houses smarter, safer and more efficient.

HouseLogix VoicePod, voice-controlled home-automation system

If your home truly is your castle, then the wireless HouseLogic VoicePod makes you its undisputed monarch. The small tabletop unit’s embedded software enables you to bark out simple commands and get instant results – no questions asked or protest lodged. Whether locking doors, turning on the heat or a television, or shutting off lights, you rule. The VoicePod works in conjunction with a Control4 home-automation system, and one VoicePod covers about a 700sq-ft (65m) room. ($649; www.voicepod.com)

Philips Hue, smart LED lightbulb system

When the lightbulb sprang from Thomas Alva Edison’s brainpan in the late 1870s, it is safe to surmise that the Hue – a wireless-controlled lighting system that turns the common lightbulb into a timer, a security device, a mood-setter and more – was not even a glimmer in his vision. Armed with Hue lightbulbs, a router-like device (with capacity to control 50 bulbs) and a mobile app, a homeowner can use a smartphone or tablet to brighten or dim lights, change a bulb’s colour, time lights to automatically turn on or off or be programmed to slowly brighten or fade. You can even turn lights on or off remotely, or make them pulse to the beat of music. (Starter kit: $100; www.meethue.com)

iRobot Roomba 800 Series, robotic vacuum cleaner

In the 1960s US cartoon show The Jetsons, the futuristic family relied on Rosie, an aproned robotic maid, to perform household chores. The Roomba 800 Series vacuum cleaner is a far more sophisticated articulation of the robot-maid ideal; think technological chateaubriand to Rosie’s ground chuck. The Roomba relies on a system of software and sensors that enable it to quietly navigate around your home’s effects. When finished, the Roomba returns to its base for recharging. And owners can program it to work whenever and wherever it suits, up to seven times a week. ($699; www.irobot.com)

Honda Miimo 500 robotic lawnmower

Convincing one’s spouse that the lawn is not in dire need of a mowing can be as fraught as eating fugu. The answer? The Miimo, which promotes domestic tranquility by removing the chore entirely from the resident mower’s to-do list. The Miimo uses an intelligent combination of controls, timers and real-time sensory feedback to cut the grass. Concerned that the Miimo might do an Edward Scissorshands-like move on your neighbour’s back 40? Fear not. The user defines the Miimo’s cutting territory with a perimeter wire that sends out electric signals, much like an electric fence for pets. ($3,100; www.honda.co.uk/garden/miimo)

For those who remember HAL 9000, the congenial but ultimately diabolical computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Jibo could be thought of as HAL’s cuter, infinitely more friendly döppelganger. Just 11in (28cm) tall, the unfailingly polite and interactive robo-servant uses artificial-intelligence algorithms to become the personal assistant you never knew you always wanted. Available in 2015, the “male-gendered” Jibo is a veritable Swiss Army knife of functionality, able to take family photos, keep a record of appointments, recite stories to your children and engage in casual conversation. Just don’t let “him” see your credit card number. ($499; www.myjibo.com)

Not long ago, programmable thermostats seemed like cutting-edge technology. Then along comes the Nest from Nest Labs, a thermostat that educates itself, like a home-schooled child, and learns the homeowner’s personal heating and cooling preferences. All that’s required is manual adjustment of the thermostat for about a week. During that time, the Nest learns preferences and creates a personalised heating and cooling schedules, and keeps adapting to any future changes in usage patterns. The unit can be adjusted remotely via a smartphone or tablet, and it even senses your absence – not unlike the family dog – and turns off the heat or air conditioner after you leave home, lowering usage and, consequently, utility bills.

Ecovas Winbot 7 Series, robotic window-washer

Even if you don’t suffer from climacophobia (fear of climbing ladders) or acrophobia (fear of heights), it is easy to admire the labour-saving Winbot, which just might send squeegees to history’s dustbin. The robot employs a powerful suction mechanism to cling to windows or mirrors, Spider-Man-style, then uses sensors to map out an efficient cleaning path. The Winbot definitely won’t cure phobias, but it will relieve at least one preoccupation. ($300; www.ecovacs.com)

Monsieur, artificially intelligent robotic bartender

How can you be the life of the party when you’re head is stuck in a mixology book? Enter the Monsieur, a robotic bartender that mixes tailored-to-taste cocktails. Seriously. It can mix literally hundreds of different drinks, and it learns your preferences for stronger or weaker pours. Not sure what to drink? Ask Monsieur and it’ll make suggestions. This robotic Sam Malone also will accept orders via smartphone. And it even tracks your alcohol consumption and sends you a smartphone link to a taxi service if it thinks you’ve overindulged. It's a personal bartender that has also is your bar-back. ($3,999; www.monsieur.co)

August Smart Lock, Bluetooth-activated deadbolt lock

Leaving a house key with the neighbours in case of the dreaded home lockout is so yesterday, thanks to the Smart Lock. This device provides keyless access to your home through a virtual key, enabled on a smartphone or tablet. It uses secure, encrypted locking technology, similar to that used by financial institutions for on-line banking. You control who has access, as well as that access’s duration. The Smart Lock can even sense your approach and unlock doors for you. It’s a personal valet of sorts – and no tipping required. ($250; www.august.com)

The Clapper, sound-activated electrical outlet

This much-ridiculed yet deceptively ingenious device, made famous by late-night US television commercials, is not exactly new, having first been shipped in 1986. But this sound-activated electrical switch, which can flip two devices on or off with the clap of a hand, was pretty advanced for its time. And almost 30 years after Joseph Enterprises introduced it, the Clapper – along with its sing-song-ey “Clap on! Clap off!” slogan-cum-jingle – remains a pop-culture touchstone, as well as a convenient step-saver. And for that, it deserves a standing ovation. ($20; www.chiapet.com)

Mankind is rethinking how we build the structures we live and work in – and that, in turn, is changing the way our cities look and feel.

Using striking technical breakthroughs in complex computation and highly sensitive manufacturing, designers are moving closer to making lightweight buildings that can move, and perhaps even think and feel. Instead of hard, polished building faces, emerging prototypes from some of the world’s research centres suggest future cities might begin to resemble artificial floating forests.

Rather than a civic plaza made from polished stone, new public gathering spaces could be softly layered, their resilient woven fabrics arranged in multiple hovering skins. Instead of clear skies and open air, our atmosphere could be filled with lacy meshwork that filters air and renews the environment.

Technical crafts made possible by new research in thermodynamics are now presenting remarkable new opportunities for architectural designers to work with air, gas and fluids as building materials. Yale mechanical engineer Michelle Addington has vividly documented control systems for dynamic plumes of heating and cooling air that enclose building surfaces, and has demonstrated that similar convection patterns occur around human bodies. Addington’s vision implies that tangible air currents and gaseous concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen around the buildings we live and work in could become practical building materials for tomorrow’s architecture.

Similarly, new clothing by Amsterdam couture designer Iris Van Herpen elevates beyond the surface of the body and extends into surrounding space, extending tendrils and plumes and interacting with the layers of the air that surrounds us. Making these invisible currents visible, thermal cameras such as those first used by the Quebec filmmaker Philippe Baylaucq will soon be available to designers. Baylaucq’s cinematography suggests that the energy concentrating and dispersing around our bodies might become a tangible part of future public urban space.

In the hands of new researchers, these kinds of subtle energy exchanges might develop even further to become part of new artificial living systems. Exploring new chemical reactions within dynamic gaseous and fluid environments, British and Danish artificial life researchers such as Rachel Armstrong and Martin Hanczyc are designing ""protocells"" – a mix of chemicals which behave in a similar way to regular cells. They oscillate, move, and generate skins of delicate material that could one day be used to clothe a building that grows and renews its own coverings.

The emerging qualities in this experimental work could guide the practical design of new architecture. An expanded range of screens and canopies built with minutely balanced filtering layers could work with convective air and currents of heating and cooling air encircling a new urban architecture. Within this kind of city ""fabric"", the thermal plumes emitted by each human occupant offer a new form of energy to be captured and used to operate entirely ductless buildings.

Some of these technologies are already being implemented in emerging cities. Alexander Rieck is one of a group of visionary designers who have contributed to Masdar Eco City, a desert-surrounded oasis in Abu Dhabi where garden-filled laneways and rooftops have been designed to make the world’s first carbon-neutral city. A vast central cluster of opening and closing solar powered ""sunflower"" umbrellas capture the sun’s rays during the day and fold at night releasing stored heat in a continual cycle. By following the projection of the sun, continuous shade is provided to the main plaza of the city.

The American designer Mitchell Joachim of Terreform is working to engineer living tissues into viable buildings. Terreform’s plans for a vast site covering Brooklyn’s Navy Yard shows a densely interwoven fertile fabric of elevated walkways, plazas and buildings made from hybrid composite materials that include engineered animal tissues, living trees, and lightweight manufactured screens, all manicured like a fantastic topiary.","Cities of smooth stone and steel may turn into floating forests â with buildings that can think , breathe and cool themselves, says architect Philip Beesley.",26.1428571429,1.0,7.7142857143,medium,high,mixed,architecture

In a live broadcast in both Hebrew and English on Israeli TV, Benjamin Netanyahu accused Kerry of focusing heavily on Israeli settlements, while paying little attention to Palestinian incitement and violence.

""Secretary Kerry paid lip service to the unremitting campaign of terrorism that has been waged by the Palestinians against the Jewish state for nearly a century,"" Netanyahu said in English.

""What he did was to spend most of his speech blaming Israel for the lack of peace, by passionately condemning a policy of enabling Jews to live in their historic homeland and in their eternal capital Jerusalem.""

In his speech at the U.S. State Department earlier on Wednesday, Kerry warned that the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was ""in serious jeopardy.""

Just weeks before the Obama administration hands over power to president-elect Donald Trump, Kerry defended the U.S. decision to allow for the passage of a United Nations resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements, saying it was intended to preserve the possibility of the two-state solution.

""We cannot, in good conscience, do nothing, and say nothing, when we see the hope of peace slipping away,"" Kerry said.

""The truth is that trends on the ground — violence, terrorism, incitement, settlement expansion and the seemingly endless occupation — are destroying hopes for peace on both sides and increasingly cementing an irreversible one-state reality that most people do not actually want.""

Kerry, pushing back at Israel's fury over the U.S. abstention on the United Nations vote, questioned Netanyahu's commitment to Palestinian statehood, which has formed the basis for all serious peace talks for years.

Though Netanyahu says he believes in the two-state solution, Kerry said, under his leadership Israel's government is ""the most right-wing in Israel's history.""

""If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic; it cannot be both, and it won't ever really be at peace,"" Kerry said in a farewell speech, a comprehensive airing of grievances that have built up in the Obama administration over eight years but were rarely, until this month, discussed publicly.

U.S. president-elect Donald Trump tweeted, 'Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!,' citing the day he takes office. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)

But Netanyahu emphasized his country's desire for peace with the Palestinians, saying it would only happen through ""direct negotiations.""

""Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders,"" he said. ""Israel's hand has been extended in peace to its neighbours from day one, from its very first day. We've prayed for peace. We've worked for it every day since then.""

In response to Kerry's speech, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he is ready to resume peace talks with Israel if it halts settlement construction.

Abbas said Wednesday any talks would take place ""within a specific time frame and on the basis of international law."" He said that would include a reference to the UN Security Council resolution passed last week, over Israel's objections.

Abbas' comments reiterated long-standing Palestinian positions and did not address the six principles for peace Kerry outlined in his speech.

The Palestinians object to calls to recognize Israel as the homeland of the Jews, saying it would undermine the rights of Israel's Arab minority and the claims of Palestinian refugees whose families lost properties in what is now Israel.

The extraordinary display of discord between allies — with U.S. and Israeli officials openly disparaging each other — has also pitted President Barack Obama against Trump, who has firmly taken Netanyahu's side.

Trump on Wednesday chided the Obama administration for its stance toward Israel.

Trump, who has vowed to pursue more pro-Israeli policies, had urged the United States to veto the UN vote.

""We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but …,"" Trump, a Republican, wrote on Twitter.

In another tweet, he said, referring to when he takes over at the White House, ""not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!""

We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but.......

not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!

Israel pulled back from approving hundreds of new homes for Israelis in East Jerusalem on Wednesday before Kerry was set to speak.

The housing projects, in areas Israel captured in the 1967 war and which Palestinians seek as part of a future state, are part of building activity that the Security Council, by a vote of 14-0, demanded be halted.

With applications for 492 building permits in the urban settlements of Ramot and Ramat Shlomo on its agenda, members of Jerusalem city hall's Planning and Building committee said a planned vote was cancelled at Netanyahu's request.

The panel's chairman, Meir Turgeman, said at the session that Netanyahu was concerned approval would have given Kerry ""ammunition before the speech.""

A spokesman for the Israeli leader declined immediate comment.

Kerry's parting words are unlikely to change anything on the ground between Israel and the Palestinians or salvage the Obama administration's record of failed Mideast peace efforts.

Obama and Netanyahu have had a rocky relationship, divided over the decades-old Israeli policy of building Jewish settlements in occupied territory as well as on how to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.

Washington considers the settlement activity illegitimate and most countries view it as an obstacle to peace.

Israel disagrees, citing a biblical, historical and political connection to the land — which the Palestinians also claim — as well as security interests.

Some 570,000 Israelis now live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem amid mounting international concern that a two-state solution to the dispute is in jeopardy, with peace talks stalled since 2014.

Netanyahu's aides are confident Trump's incoming administration will likely ignore any Obama principles and pay no heed to the UN resolution. But they fear Kerry's remarks will put Israel on the defensive and prompt other countries to apply pressure.

Trump has pledged to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its capital — a status that is not recognized internationally. And he has appointed his lawyer, who has raised funds for a major Jewish settlement in the West Bank, as the new ambassador.

It was one of two weekend building collapses that killed at least 22 people.

Nearly 90 contract workers were believed to have been in the basement of the 11-story structure to collect their wages when it collapsed Saturday on the outskirts of Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state.

Police said 31 had been pulled out so far, four died on the spot and another seven succumbed to injuries in a hospital.

The exact number of those trapped was unknown but rescuers could hear feeble voices in the debris, said T.S. Sridhar, the disaster management agency commissioner.

Nearly 300 police and fire service workers worked overnight, looking for survivors in the debris. Officials used gas cutters, iron rods and shovels after cranes lifted concrete blocks to get to the survivors.

""Removing debris is a major challenge. It may take two to three days to clear the rubble,"" said S.P. Selvam, who is heading the rescue operation.

Rescue workers carry the body of an injured man at the site of the collapsed 11-storey building that was under construction on the outskirts of the southern Indian city of Chennai. (Reuters)

Police officer Fernandes said two directors, two engineers and one supervisor of the construction company, Prime Sristi, were detained for questioning as authorities began investigating the collapse.

Balaguru, one of the builders, said the structure collapsed possibly due to the impact of lightning.

""Usually, once the construction gets over we install the equipment to prevent the building from a thunder strike. It was nearing completion,"" the Press Trust of India news agency quoted Balaguru, who uses one name, as saying.

Earlier Saturday, a four-story, 50-year-old structure toppled in an area of New Delhi inhabited by the poor. Eleven people died and one survivor was being treated in a hospital, said fire service officer Praveer Haldiar.

Most homes in that part of the capital were built without permission and using substandard materials, police officer Madhur Verma said.

The Press Trust of India news agency said the New Delhi collapse was triggered by construction work on an adjacent plot.

Building collapses are common in India, where high demand for housing and lax regulations have encouraged some builders to cut corners, use substandard materials or add unauthorized extra floors.

(Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)

Prime Minister Stephen Harper will be in Inuvik, N.W.T., on Wednesday to formally mark the start of construction on a 140-kilometre highway between the town and Tuktoyaktuk.

The long-promised highway is expected to take four years to build, with construction happening only during the winter months when the ground is firm. Initial construction started early last year.

The federal government has promised $200 million for the highway, with the territory voting last spring to spend $65 million on it, in addition to $12 million already invested in getting the project started.

For years, people in the Northwest Territories' Mackenzie Delta region lobbied for the 140-kilometre all-weather road to link the two communities, which are currently connected by air or ice road only.

About 1,000 jobs will be created over the four-year construction period.

For the Conservative government, it will stretch Canada's road network further north and hearkens back to former prime minister John Diefenbaker's vision of connecting the north to the rest of Canada.

N.W.T. Premier Bob McLeod and federal Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq will be at the ceremonial groundbreaking along with Harper.

The project has faced criticism, with some arguing the benefits are questionable.

MLA Norman Yakelaya argued in October that the territory's Sahtu region, where almost all of its oil and gas activity is occurring, currently has no highway connecting it to northern parts of the territory.

""The government is right now focusing on the Inuvik-Tuk highway because the federal government dropped $200 million into our coffers,"" he said. ""The federal government is dictating where the priority is, even though right now the hot spot is in the Sahtu with the oil and gas exploration.""

A senior government source played up the economic benefits in an email to CBC News.

It is hoped the crane will be dismantled by Thursday night.

The blaze damaged nearby buildings and also led to the dramatic rescue of a crane operator stranded above the flames by a helicopter team from CFB Trenton.

The crane operator, Adam Jastrezbski, suffered burns to his hands, back and legs, but is improving in hospital, according to his wife, Helena.

The site continued to smoulder into early Wednesday evening. Firefighters can't get too close to the site until the crane is taken down, so they can't douse any remaining hot spots.

Staff with the Office of the Fire Marshal of Ontario, the Kingston fire department and Ontario's Ministry of Labour are planning how to move forward.

Kingston fire Chief Rhéaume Chaput estimated the fire reached temperatures of about 1,000 F, and said that steel begins to be compromised at about 600 F.

The crane, charred and structurally damaged by the intense heat, could collapse, officials say. Kingston fire Chief Rhéaume Chaput says crews hope to have the crane down by Thursday night. (CBC)

Everyone within a two-block radius of the structurally compromised crane are still waiting to return to their homes.

""Being right in the middle of a populated downtown part of the city of Kingston, there are several buildings that ... the crane could actually collapse onto,"" Kingston Mayor Mark Gerretsen said Wednesday morning.

Gerretson said later on Wednesday damage to the adjacent Royal Canadian Legion Villa would result in long-term displacement for residents of the seniors home. The building's roof caught fire as the blaze spread on Tuesday.

Gerretsen told CBC News he had concerns about the wooden building that caught fire Tuesday – leading to the dramatic helicopter rescue – well before flames broke out.

""I'll be the first to admit — driving by this building, and I did on a daily basis — as I saw the wood structure go up, and having some experience in the construction world outside of my business at city hall, I thought to myself, 'Well, this is a pretty big structure to be made out of wood entirely,'"" he said.

""I think that many members of the community shared that concern.""

Power had to be shut off in the area around the fire in Kingston, Ont., and residents living within a half-kilometre of the scene were taken to an emergency shelter. (Bruce Cadieux/Twitter)

Gerretsen stressed that the city has no say over materials used in the construction of any building. That's covered by provincial legislation

""What I can tell you is that a proper building permit was taken out, and that according to the design, it adhered to the building code,"" the mayor said.

Power was shut off in the area around the fire and residents living within a half-kilometre were taken to an emergency shelter at the Portsmouth Olympic Harbour.

Residents who had nowhere else to go were put up in hotels by the city, Gerretsen said.

Police said residents have been asked to stay away from the perimeter of the fire, from Concession Street to the north and west, Albert Street to the east and Dundas Street to the south. They said they'll be advising residents when they can re-enter the evacuation zone to collect pets or other items.

The above area was blocked off to all traffic Wednesday due to concerns that the damaged crane could collapse. The information for the graphic was obtained on the City of Kingston's website. (CBC)

The developer of the commercial and residential housing complex, Patry Inc. Developments, issued a statement Wednesday saying it was thankful no lives were lost in the fire and thanked Kingston Fire Rescue, Kingston police, Kingston EMS, Trenton Search and Rescue, neighbouring fire departments and all other individuals/organizations who assisted to prevent loss of life.

The company said the cause of the fire is still under investigation, and in its statement defended its choice to use wood in the construction of the building.

""Regarding the suitability of wood construction for this project, large wood frame construction buildings are built throughout the country and have been since 1990; there are thousands of these buildings located throughout Canada.

""Furthermore, the building has been designed and was constructed to meet all Ontario Building Code and Ontario Fire Code requirements. It is of note that this is a construction site fire, and as with any building material during the construction phase, it is more vulnerable to fire damage in comparison to a completed building where all fire and safety features are in place,"" the statement read.

Many students were expected to move into the building when it was completed. The company said for people who signed leases for September 2014, the company said it would be in touch ""in the near future as the situation is assessed.""

Construction at the site was being overseen by Stelmach Property Management.

The military rescue team that answered the call from the Kingston fire department on Tuesday afternoon credited their regular training with helping them handle what they called an ""unusual rescue.""

Sgt. Cory Cisyk, a search and rescue technician for 424 Transport and Rescue Squadron based at 8 Wing Trenton at CFB Trenton, said the crew didn't know what to expect as they were flying to Kingston, but they had a couple of different plans.

Capt. David Agnew said at a news conference Wednesday at CFB Trenton that as the crew approached the fire they were concerned the blaze or smoke might interfere with the rescue.

""I can't imagine [the crane operator's] perspective,"" said Agnew. ""From miles off in the distance we could see the flames and the smoke.

Sgt. Cory Cisyk was the rescue technician who was lowered from a helicopter to save a crane operator stranded above the massive fire in Kingston, Ont.

Based on the information they received, the crew planned a ""double-up"" rescue in which Cisyk would be lowered from the chopper on a cable and then use a strap or ""horse collar"" to wrap around the crane operator to pull him up.

Cisyk said that when he first made contact with Jastrezbski, the crane operator, it was difficult to communicate with him because of the noise from the helicopter.

""I tried to explain what I was going to do. I don't know if he understood,"" said Cicyk, a native of Regina.

Cisyk said it took time to get the collar around the man because he was lying down at the end of the crane's boom, but he got help from the helicopter flight engineer, Corp. Iain Cleaton, who gently hoisted the two up to help them stand.

Once he got the crane operator in the chopper, Cisyk said, he had only a brief conversation with him to find out if he was hurt.

The crane operator was taken to hospital with minor injuries.

""For us, this was extremely unusual. But even discussing with the crew afterwards … we really figured that the training we do every day really came into it and played a big factor in ... the way things ran.""

John Ashie, who was working at his family's car dealership down the street, said the entire episode was like something out of an action film.

""Especially when the helicopter guy was rescuing him from the crane, everyone was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this is happening, it's just so surreal,""' said Ashie.

David Elias, a civilian public affairs officer with the Canadian military, said the crews are normally not involved in urban rescues.

""The number of times we would have hoisted someone off a crane like this, I imagine we could count that on one hand. Normally we are hoisting people off of boats or mountains,"" said Elias.

""He wasn't just standing on a tower crane. He was standing on a tower crane surrounded by flames.""

All construction workers at the site are believed to be accounted for, according to Kingston police.

""We're extremely grateful of the amazing work done by CFB Trenton to rescue that one individual that everybody was worried about,"" Gerretsen told CBC's Power & Politics host Evan Solomon Tuesday. ""This is a day that the public can be extremely proud of your emergency workers.""",Kingston's fire chief says crews are hoping to take down the crane badly damaged by yesterday's intense fire.,78.9047619048,1.0,8.9047619048,high,high,extractive,architecture

Taylor said they escaped safely when smoke began to fill the apartment as the flames spread in the unit below. Her son Carson had woken up and lain on the floor, covering his head with a blanket, as firefighters had taught him at school last year.

“I was even told that if I wasn't awake we probably wouldn't have made it out, which is very scary to think of,” said Taylor, who is currently living with her brother-in-law in Vanier while her children stay with relatives in nearby Bancroft, Ont.

Taylor said they lost almost everything in the near half-million-dollar fire, but she did manage to save her dress that she is set to wear for her wedding next October.

The couple also saved their wedding rings and some furniture.

Taylor, who lived in the building for about 18 months, has received support from the Salvation Army and Canadian Red Cross, who responded the day of the fire. What came after was not expected, she said, as neighbours and strangers offered and collected donations.

“(It’s) definitely been overwhelming, the amount of help we've had,” she said. “(There have been) a lot of tears of joy, we look at it more as a blessing rather than a curse.""

Carson’s school and a nearby convenience store are collecting donations, Taylor added.

She has also used money that was saved up for her honeymoon and hopes to find a new house by Dec. 1 so she can be reunited with her three children.

This spring marks the opening of Carmel Place, the city's first apartment building made up entirely of micro apartments. Ranging in size from 260 to 360 square feet, the units were built to find space for the growing number of single-person households moving to the city.

""Anybody who's not from New York doesn't necessarily understand how crazy it is, how expensive it is and how challenging it is to find space,"" said Canadian Eric Bunge, a principal with nARCHITECTS, which designed Carmel Place.

Bunge, who arrived in New York more than a decade ago from Montreal, won a design competition held in 2012 by then-mayor Michael Bloomberg.

To create Carmel Place, the city relaxed the 1987 law that prevented the construction of any apartment smaller than 400 square feet. New York has a long history of tenement buildings dating back to the 19th and early 20th century, when large families would squeeze into small, one-room apartments, often living in poor conditions.

On a recent tour of the new building, Bunge showed off one of the mid-size micro apartments, measuring 302 square feet. With nearly 10-foot ceilings, a Juliet balcony and clean, modern furnishings, he said the goal is to make the space feel larger than it is.

""We want to design humane apartments that may be small in footprints, but larger in every other sense,"" Bunge said.

New York's current housing stock, he said, is aimed at families, which make up less than 20 per cent of the city's population. That means two- or three-bedroom apartments get subdivided among single residents, driving up the rent.

Tobias Oriwol is another Canadian involved in the project, working with Monadnock Development at the time. He said creative design allows them to fit more into the small space

He demonstrated how the bed folds down from the wall over the couch and coffee table, the latter of which can convert to a high top for meals. The desk in the kitchen expands to become a kitchen table and the clothing rod in the closet pulls out to create more storage space.

""This is 300 usable square feet compared to units of similar size that aren't as efficient,"" Oriwol said.

The building also offers a number of amenities to entice renters, he said, including a gym, shared dining room and internet. Some apartments even come with a package that includes a concierge who restocks the fridge.

Micro apartments have been growing in popularity across the U.S., with developments in cities like Boston and San Francisco, though size and price differ in each municipality.

As part of New York's plan, 14 of the 55 units are designated for low-income earners and rent will be subsidized. Another eight units will be reserved for previously homeless veterans. They received 60,000 applications for the affordable units, Oriwol said.

As for the other market-rate units, he said a typical 302-square-feet unit, furnished with weekly cleaning, internet, cable and concierge service, is listed at $2,750 US a month — in line with the city's other new-construction units.

So far Carmel Place is a one-off project, but both Bunge and Oriwol hope the building will be a model for developers and the city.",Could you live in a space measuring 360 square feet or less?

Accepted oilpatch wisdom suggests the market, which hasn't put up the cash for a major new gasoline-producing refinery in North America since 1984, has already made the decision for her.

Why, then, is Notley's government still pledging to crack open the file and take another look?

""I believe there is a better way to build Alberta's economy, to put refineries like these at the heart of our future growth and prosperity,"" Notley told supporters at a campaign event in April held in front of a row of upgraders near Edmonton.

For oil types, such talk is like seeing the smoking gun that proves an NDP government simply doesn't understand how the industry works.

And yet, the pro-refinery camp remains undeterred in its belief that Canadians should be more than just hewers of wood and drawers of water.

Assuming that both sides of the debate are working with the same dispassionate figures about North American refining capacity, shouldn't the number crunchers be able to arrive at a consensus about whether a refinery makes economic sense?

Clearly, the answer is no. What's more, deep ideological and practical differences exist between the two sides that make a meeting of the minds unlikely.

The bedrock of the argument against spending billions on a refinery, whether the money is private or public, is based in part on the supply and demand fundamentals of the North American refining business.

Since refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast are already working with spare capacity, why would anyone commit to building a new plant? The refinery game isn't easy. Plants are expensive to build, tough to operate and prone to cost overruns.

""Unless you see some sort of policy that's coming from the government that's saying, 'We'll jump on board and we'll help you get this value-added sector of the provincial economy started,' I can't see a stand-alone commercial development happening,"" says Dinara Millington, vice-president of research at the Canadian Energy Research Institute.

Alberta may contain vast oil reserves, but as a hub for converting that crude into gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel, it's hamstrung by geography.

An ideal location for a refinery would include access to tidewater, so the end product could be easily shipped to where it's needed; existing infrastructure; and proximity to big markets to limit transportation costs.

Compared to the Gulf Coast's refinery row, landlocked Alberta comes up short.

The flare stacks of an oilsands processing plant in Alberta. (CBC)

The case against building an upgrader for oil sands crude as opposed to a refinery is similar, but also comes with nuances.

To name one, the poor outlook for Alberta's current foray into that game, the North West Upgrader, now known as the Sturgeon Refinery, certainly counts as a strike against the idea that constructing a value-added plant will actually result in adding value.

In terms of job creation, economists such as the University of Alberta's Andrew Leach also mount a convincing argument that simply shifting employment from extracting oil sands to the refining side of the business isn't a net benefit to the provincial economy.

Additionally, spending public money on a refinery comes with an opportunity cost to other government priorities such as education and health care.

Although the hard market logic of building a new refinery would seem to be stacked against the idea, proponents say not so fast. A decision to build a refinery needs to include market-based factors such as the spread between crude prices and refined products, but those aren't the only considerations.

A broader cost-benefit analysis, they argue, that includes measures such as job creation, engineering know-how, and other valuable economic spinoffs to industry shows that a refinery project has the potential to be a big win for the province in the long term.

""I wouldn't for an instant say, 'Damn the torpedoes, build a new refinery, no matter what,'"" says Jim Stanford, an economist with Unifor, the country's largest private sector union. ""But I do think the assumption that the private market can make an accurate decision on this unfettered by government is fantasy.""

What's in Canadians' public interest, he says, isn't always the same as what's in the best interest of a company such as Exxon. For a company, wanting to put spare refining capacity in to good use is sensible. Whether it's in Canada's best economic interests to see oil sands bitumen refined on the Gulf Coast is another question.

""If you're just looking at it solely as a private company, then you don't care about the jobs that are created, you don't care about the taxes that are paid, you don't care about the engineering capabilities that are developed because you can do this type of thing in your country,"" says Stanford.

""There are reasons we should pay attention to it from a policy perspective, rather than just assuming that if the market thinks it makes sense then the market will do it.""

Whether the market should be the final arbiter of investment decisions or if government intervention has a place is a fundamental question that not only divides the two camps in the refinery debate, but also promises to take on a new currency in provincial politics.

Other NDP platform issues, such as a royalty review, higher corporate taxes and limiting carbon emissions, may be getting more attention, but that doesn't mean the refinery plank was just a calculated throw-in to appease the party's base.

It may not make economic sense to Big Oil, but in Notley's Alberta it appears that may no longer be the only opinion that matters.","Conventional wisdom in the oilpatch suggests a refinery in Alberta doesn't make economic sense. And yet, the new NDP government still wants to look at building one. What's up with that?",30.972972973,0.9459459459,1.8648648649,medium,high,mixed,architecture

In the early 1990s, the federal government helped establish workplace daycare centres in federal buildings across the country, providing a full-rent subsidy as long as 70 per cent of the spaces were used by parents working in the public service.

At one point, about a dozen daycare centres existed for public servants from Edmonton to Shawinigan, Que., including five in Ottawa.

The Treasury Board recently rescinded its policy to subsidize daycare rents, putting the onus on individual departments to ""establish and maintain such facilities when they are a sound investment for the well-being of employees and the organization.""

On Dec. 1, the Tupper Tots daycare facility in the Sir Charles Tupper Building on Riverside Drive announced its closure.

The Tupper Tots daycare moved to Baseline Road after the rent increase but still struggled financially. (CBC)

The Tupper Tots board of directors said the money problems began when the federal subsidy was cancelled and the daycare was asked to pay more than $230,000 a year in rent.

""I'm angry with … the federal government for basically turning their back on their own employees who needed access to childcare,"" said Shellie Bird of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents daycare workers at Tupper Tots.

The childcare program at Tunney’s Pasture recently renegotiated a five-year lease with Public Works and Government Services Canada. However, one worker told CBC News the rent will double over the next two years and questions remain about whether the daycare will survive at that location over the long term.

A potential rent increase is also a worry for the daycare centre at the Sunflower Co-op, operated out of a federal building on Montreal Road.

""Children on the Hill,"" a program used by bureaucrats, politicians and members of the press gallery, currently operates rent-free out of a building on Parliament Hill. The arrangement with that facility dates back to the 1980s and the current board president doesn't know how long the building operator, Public Works, will continue this arrangement.

The Public Service Alliance of Canada, which represents a majority of federal workers, said it sent letters to government officials months ago seeking assurances that workplace child care centres would not only be protected, but expanded.

Larry Rousseau, a regional vice-president for the Public Service Alliance of Canada, would like to see the return of the old daycare model. (CBC)

""If you believe in daycare, then put your money where your mouth is and say, 'here's a model that works and can work in the public and private sector,'"" said a union vice-president, Larry Rousseau.

updated 5:44 AM EDT, Sun June 9, 2013

(CNN) -- The 42-year-old crane operator wanted in connection with a deadly Philadelphia building collapse is expected to appear in court Sunday to face charges.

Sean Benschop turned himself in Saturday. He will be charged with six counts of involuntary manslaughter, 13 counts of recklessly endangering another person and one count of ""risking a catastrophe,"" officials said.

Wednesday's building collapse in downtown Philadelphia left six dead and 13 people injured.

Blaming the suspect's ""reckless and irresponsible behavior"" for the casualties, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said Saturday that he hopes Benschop faces ""the harshest level of charges ... and he is punished accordingly.""

""Justice will only be served if Sean Benschop receives a sentence that buries him in a jailhouse forever, just like his victims were buried on Wednesday,"" the mayor said.

Daine Grey, Benschop's attorney, told reporters Saturday that while his client feels ""extremely sympathetic and remorseful,"" he's not guilty of any crime.

""This was an accident, but Mr. Benschop was not responsible,"" Grey said, in remarks captured by CNN affiliate WPVI. ""And we believe that, in time, the facts will show that he is not responsible.""

A judge signed an arrest warrant -- which had been approved by Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams -- on Friday night or Saturday morning, police said.

Benschop should make his first court appearance via closed circuit TV within 12 to 24 hours of his arrest, according to Philadelphia police spokesman Lt. John Stanford. At that point, a judge will determine what the bail amount will be in his case.

""The district attorney hopes the arrest of the defendant will be of some comfort to all of the victims and their families affected by this heartbreaking tragedy,"" district attorney's office spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson said.

Benschop allegedly was working a crane to tear down a vacant building in downtown Philadelphia when a four-story wall collapsed onto a Salvation Army thrift store, causing an ominous rumble followed by panic on the streets.

Afterward, searchers climbed over shards of wood, concrete and rebar looking for survivors, such as 61-year-old woman pulled alive from the rubble early Thursday.

The first lawsuit was filed that same day, by attorneys for a 54-year-old woman pulled from the rubble by a firefighter.

Benschop, the crane operator, had marijuana and pain medication in his blood after the collapse, a law enforcement source told CNN.

Pennsylvania court records indicate Benschop, who also went by the alias Kary Roberts, has been arrested multiple times in the past two decades. Many of the related charges -- related to alleged firearms violations and theft -- were withdrawn, dismissed or resulted in not guilty verdicts, though he was found guilty in the mid-1990s on drug charges.

A day after publicly apologizing ""to the victims and their families"" and promising to do everything possible ""to find out what went wrong,"" Nutter pressed Saturday to get answers from two property owners who hired Benschop to operate heavy machinery.

""These three individuals bear the ultimate and sole responsibility for this tragedy,"" the mayor said.",The crane operator wanted in connection with the Philadelphia building collapse is expected to appear in court,37.0588235294,1.0,6.2941176471,high,high,mixed,architecture

Workers using heavy machinery are gradually picking apart the huge, splintered slabs of concrete at the scene of the collapse in Savar, a suburb of the national capital, Dhaka. They continue to find and remove bodies, many of them decomposed and difficult to recognize.

Meanwhile, Pope Francis, speaking at a Mass on Wednesday, made reference to the building collapse in a sharp condemnation of worker exploitation and ""slave labor.""

""Not paying a just (wage), not providing work, focusing exclusively on the balance books, on financial statements, only looking at making personal profit. That goes against God!"" he said, quoted on the Vatican Radio website.

The collapse of the building has caused widespread anger among Bangladesh's millions of garment workers about the risky conditions in which many of them must work.

Anger in Bangladesh focuses on building owner, rejection of aid

Frequent protests, some of them involving violent clashes with police, have taken place in Dhaka and nearby manufacturing districts since the disaster.

On Wednesday, when workers around the world were holding May Day rallies, thousands of Bangladeshis took to the streets once again, although no clashes were initially reported.

As trucks carrying rubble leave the scene of the catastrophe, people searching desperately for missing relatives crowd around them, wanting to make sure they're not mistakenly taking away the bodies of their loved ones, said Maj. Gen. Hassan Sarwardy, the military official leading the recovery efforts.

There was confusion earlier about exactly how many people were still unaccounted for in the collapse, Sarwardy said at a news briefing Wednesday. Authorities were waiting for the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association to provide a list of all the people who were inside the five garment factories in the building when it caved in, he said.

When that information was obtained, Sarwardy said it appeared about 149 people were still missing.

""It is very unlikely that someone is still alive under the rubble on the seventh day of the building collapse... but the almighty Allah knows better,"" the military official said.

Authorities say the number of people confirmed dead so far is 412, while 2,443 people have been recovered alive, according to the official Bangladesh State News Agency.

And so, the search for the human remains still entombed within the ruins goes on amid the stench of death that pervades the site.

Those involved in the search are using face masks and cans of air freshener to try to block out the smell, and electronic sensors and sniffer dogs to try to find the bodies.

Col. Shayekh Jaman, one of the officials involved in the operation, said Wednesday that he believed the grueling, painstaking efforts could continue for about 10 more days.

""It is a delicate and time-consuming operation, but we are doing everything we can,"" he said.

After building collapse, Shahina's death breaks rescuers' hearts

Meanwhile, hundreds of people like Sheikh Nasir Uddin are left in limbo.

At the school playground in Savar where bodies recovered from the wreckage are initially brought for identification, Uddin said he had being looking for his nephew Abul Kalam Azad for the past week.

He said visits to all the hospitals in Savar and Dhaka where the injured and the dead were taken had proved fruitless.

""Nobody can tell me about my nephew, who was working at an apparel factory in the building,"" he said.

Much of the rage voiced in protests has been directed at Sohel Rana, the owner of the building, who was arrested near the Indian border over the weekend. Protesters have called for him to be hanged.

Rana and the owners of the factories in his building have been accused of ordering workers to enter the premises on the day of the collapse, despite the discovery of large cracks the day before.

Americans face tough choices over Bangladesh

The Bangladeshi government is also coming under criticism for lax enforcement of safety regulations in factories and claims by Britain and the United Nations that it refused offers of help with rescue efforts.

Home Minister Mahiuddin Khan Alamgir said Tuesday that the rejection was because Bangladesh had only wanted equipment to be sent, not the additional search and rescue experts offered by the outside agencies.

In a sign of the growing international pressure on Dhaka to improve labor conditions, the European Union said Tuesday that it was considering trade action against Bangladesh. The statement carries weight, since the EU is Bangladesh's largest trade partner.

The Bangladeshi government said this week that it would begin inspecting the safety and security of all garment factories in the country.

Major Western retailers and clothing brands, some of which sourced products from the factories in the collapsed building, are also facing difficult questions about how closely they scrutinize working conditions at their suppliers.

""We understand that businesses operating in this building appear to have links to numerous companies in the U.S. and Europe and so we'll continue to engage with U.S. companies to discuss what role they can play in improving working conditions, including in Bangladesh,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said Wednesday.

The catastrophic building collapse happened about five months after a fire at Tazreen Fashions Factory, a garment maker in another suburb of Dhaka, killed at least 112 people.

New Delhi (CNN) -- At least 46 people have died -- including 17 children -- and dozens have been injured after an illegal building still under construction collapsed in western India, police said Friday.

The building, in Thane, about 10 kilometers northeast of central Mumbai, caved in on Thursday evening, said Digambar Jangale, a local police official.

Seventy people have been injured, according to another police official, Vinod Parab.

Rescuers are still searching through the wreckage, Jangale said, and five children are among those pulled alive from the rubble so far Friday.

Manoj Gohad, a senior local official, told CNN sister network IBN that people were illegally occupying the first four floors of the building even though it hadn't been completed or authorized.

Jangale said the eighth floor was still under construction when the building gave way.

The collapse might have been the result of poor construction, he said, but authorities are still investigating what caused it.

Police have registered a case of culpable homicide against the builder of the structure, who is yet to be traced, according to IBN.

London (CNN) -- Supporters of King Richard III want a just-revealed reconstruction of the monarch's head to bring a human aspect to a leader portrayed through the centuries as a murderous villain who butchered his way to power.

The Richard III Society commissioned the reconstruction -- which was unveiled before media in London Tuesday -- after remains believed to be those of the medieval king were discovered under in a parking lot in Leicester, England.

Scientists announced Monday that DNA testing had established that the skeleton was indeed that of Richard III.

Since his death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, Richard III has been portrayed as hunchbacked and hateful, accused of killing his own nephews, the ""Princes in the Tower,"" to usurp the throne.

But the Richard III Society believes the monarch has been unfairly maligned by history and in particular the Tudors who ousted him.

It says its three-dimensional model of the king shows a face ""far removed from the image of the cold-blooded villain of Shakespeare's play.""

Society chairman Dr. Phil Stone told reporters in London that the discovery and identification of the monarch had been ""a momentous time"" for the society. He praised screenwriter Philippa Langley's ""tenacity and bloody-mindedness"" in pursuing the project to locate his remains.

Langley said her aims had been two-fold -- to try to find Richard III so that his remains could be retrieved from an ""undignified place"" and to ""go in search of the real Richard III.""

Read more: Will Richard III discovery rewrite history?

Seeing the facial reconstruction, she said, had been the most important moment. ""It was the biggest moment because suddenly the aim of seeing the real Richard III came true. That's a man who is three-dimensional in every sense.""

In a statement, she said: ""The experience was breathtaking -- one of the most overwhelming moments of my life.

""I wasn't alone in finding this an approachable, kindly face, almost inviting conversation.""

Caroline Wilkinson, Professor of Craniofacial Identification at the University of Dundee led the reconstruction project.

In a statement, she said Richard III's facial structure was based on ""anatomical assessment and interpretation, and a 3D replication process known as stereolithography.""

""The final head was pained and textured with glass eyes and a wig, using the portraits as reference, to create a realistic and regal appearance.""

Janice Aitken -- from the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design at the University of Dundee -- said CT scans of the monarch's skull had been used to build the reconstruction, 70% of which was within 2mm accuracy.

Read more: Richard III: The king and the car park?

Aitken then painted his face.

""He is just a human being. Human beings have certain characteristics -- you can use artistic licence to make assumptions.""

""The most useful references were the faces of contemporaries. At one point I used my son.""

Aitken said Langley had been clearly ""taken aback"" when she saw the reconstruction for the first time and that the Richard III Society's reaction as a whole had been ""extremely gratifying.""

Stone said in a statement that the face was ""younger and fuller than we have been used to seeing, less careworn and with a hint of a smile.""

Richard III seemed ""alive and about to speak,"" he said.

""At last, it seems, we have the true image of Richard III -- is this the face that launched a thousand myths?""

Sarah Levitt, head of Leicester City Council's Arts and Museum division said the reconstruction had the presence of a ""living, breathing man.""

It would be given ""pride of place"" in the Richard III visitors center due to open in the central England city next year, she said.

A successful IPO opens the door to some exciting business opportunities. However, once your company is public, financial reporting takes on a heightened level of importance and you will face a new level of scrutiny.

So if an IPO is your goal, it’s critical to build an infrastructure that is ready for the rigors of the public markets. Develop a robust infrastructure comprised of people, processes and systems that will enable the production of timely, accurate financial information for purposes of forecasting, financial reporting and compliance with new public company regulations.

Here are five important steps in that preparation process.

1. Financial reporting: Often, newly public companies find it a challenge to produce financial statements and disclosures, along with completing the necessary executive-level reviews, under the new regulatory reporting timelines. Start early to comply with local securities laws, and consider potential IPO accounting and reporting issues. Also, practice preparing your quarterly and/or annual financial statements on an SEC-ready timeline as if you were already public for at least 2 quarters prior to the IPO.

2. IT systems: Information systems need to be aligned both with the company’s business objectives and critical reporting requirements. Management should have the informational tools that allow for timely reporting, informed decision-making and the ability to quickly answer analysts’ questions.

3. Internal controls: Develop written financial accounting and SEC reporting policies and procedures to support your public company internal control environment. At least 12 months prior to the IPO, begin executing a plan to complete management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting.

4. Forecasting: During quarterly and annual conference calls, shareholders and analysts will want to know your earnings guidance. So start now to improve your budgeting and forecasting capabilities and enhance management and financial reporting capabilities.

5. Housekeeping: There’s no time like the present to start getting your house in order. Also consider whether your existing corporate, capital, and management structures are appropriate for a public company.

EY’s experience shows that a strong infrastructure can help facilitate regulatory compliance, protect against risk exposure and provide guidance to meet or beat market expectations. Furthermore, such an infrastructure can ensure that business execution continues apace despite the focus on the IPO transaction.

(Image credit: AFP via @daylife)

One of the biggest holes the Indian economy must fill has grown deeper. Yesterday, the Reserve Bank of India released its annual report (pdf) revealing a huge drop in private investment. For infrastructure, the past year’s decline was even more substantial:

Envisaged investment in infrastructure declined by 52 per cent to Rs1.0 trillion from Rs2.2 trillion in the previous year, with power and telecom accounting for most of this fall. Investment in telecom sector has dried up, while that in road, ports and airports has also decelerated sharply. More than half of the envisaged corporate fixed investment in large projects has been coming from infrastructure since 2008-09. Its share, however, dropped to 48.6 per cent in 2011-12 from 54.8 per cent in 2010-11. This has had a ripple effect on the economy. [emphasis mine]

That halving comes from a variety of sources—poor monsoons, trouble in the entrenched coal and mining sectors and sizable losses in the public utilities. The political intransigence across the country has surely not helped.

One of the solutions on the docket, particularly for urban infrastructure, is the catchall term public-private partnerships. Earlier this week Saugata Ray, the Minister of State for Urban Development, called for more PPPs. A few large-scale projects are beginning to take shape, but with little clarity on their returns and benefits. As the head of one such project, the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor, told the Business Standard, the private sector wants more city planning before diving in. Infrastructure spending, and PPP projects, without it do little to solve the capacity problems of Indian cities, and perhaps risk making them worse.

Another obstacle is the infantile state of capital markets here. An RBI deputy governor, in a speech last winter, laid out the issue:

For large scale financing urban infrastructure which is assuming critical importance in the context of rapid urbanization, conventional fiscal transfers to the urban local bodies or municipals from governments are no longer considered sufficient. There have been some earnest experimentations by these bodies to tap unconventional methods of financing such as public private partnerships, utilizing urban assets more productively, accessing carbon credits, etc. but then these do not address the financing needs. One possible way of addressing the problem is developing a municipal bond market.

By one measure, total municipal bonds clock in around $300 million—less than 1% of the corporate market. Developing this market requires a host of changes. Not least among them is the timely, accurate release of public finances from Indian cities. At this point, that’s virtually nonexistent.

Ideas to spur the bond market also quickly return to the vicious circle of declining investment. A couple weeks ago, I asked Aromar Revi, the director of the Indian Institute for Human Settlements and an urban analyst, about pooled financing, one of these ideas. “When you’re talking about pooling bonds,” he laughed, “you have to have enough things to pool.”",Investment pouring into building the country fell by half this year.,50.25,0.6666666667000001,0.8333333333,high,low,abstractive,architecture

(Photo credit: Wikipedia)

For all the huffing and puffing and blown around houses associated with Facebook’s ugly IPO, there’s a looming problem associated with the company that’s getting lost in the mix. That’s a pity, because over the next few years it promises to have a more profound influence over the fortunes of Facebook investors than anything else.

I’m not talking about mobile, or advertising or regulation. I’m talking about the company’s dual-class share structure. As you likely know, founder Mark Zuckerberg set up the company so that Class-B shares (which he controls) carry ten times the voting power of the A-shares. That means he owns about 18% of the company, but controls more than 50% of the voting power.

It’s the preferred setup of SuperFounders and Family Scions from Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Google to Zuckerberg’s mentor, Don Graham at the stumbling, fumbling Washington Post Company to Silicon Valley newbies like Zynga and LinkedIn.

Thanks to this setup, what Zuckerberg says goes–right into the grave (he can name a successor to take control of the company in case of his death. See page 20/21 of the S1.) Because more than 50% of the voting power for the board of directors is held by one guy, Facebook listed itself under what’s called the “controlled company” exception to corporate governance rules for public companies. That means no independent board members, no compensation committee, and no independent nominating function.

“This concentrated control,” the company writes with delightful bluntness in the S1, “will limit your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.”

There’s little evidence (at least that I can find) that these kind of companies underperform peers in the market, or even trade at a discount to single-share peers. But a study by Paul Gompers, Joy Ishii and Andrew Metrick found that while large ownership stakes in insiders’ hands tend to improve corporate performance, heavy control by insiders weakens it. They tend to take on more debt, rather than dilute control through share offerings than single-share companies. Other studies found CEOs enjoy higher levels of compensation and shareholders enjoy less return on capital investments, while wasting cash and chasing goals that are personally important to those in control–not shareholders.

Overall, about 6% of US companies have this kind of structure, representing about 8% of the market’s overall capitalization. Defenders say that it insulates those in control from having to react to short-term swings in the market so they can focus on the long-term. On occasion that works (Comcast), but often it doesn’t (Washington Post, The New York Times).

In the case of Google, it allows founders Brin and Page to hold only 21.5% (as of last summer) of the economic share of the company but exercise 73% of the voting power. When they decided to shakeup their leadership team and put Page in charge, it was their decision in the end, no one else’s. The jury is out on whether it is working, with shares off 6% so far this year.

At Viacom, according to research by law firm Houlihan Lokey, 88-year-old Sumner Redstone controlled just 10% of the economic share of the company, but 79% of voting power. VIA.B shares are up 8.7% since 2007, just behind the overall Nasdaq’s 9.9%. Shareholders in The New York Times company wish they were that lucky, down more than 75% since 2007. Yes, it’s been a terrible time for media, but The Sulzberger Trust–which controls just 0.6% of the economic share of company–controls 90.1% of the voting and seem utterly unwilling to let anyone else take a turn at the tiller.

They’re hardly alone. Owners with this kind of control are basically bulletproof. You can never get rid of them, no matter how they perform. They aren’t subject to hostile takeovers, and almost never change the structure once they put in place (among all US public companies it happened only 159 times between 1995 and 2002 according to one study.) Why do investors put up with it? “The simple answer is that they don’t have much choice,” posits The New Yorker’s James Surowiecki. “Investors these days are hungry for any kind of return…This makes investors willing to accept terms that they would once have found intolerable.”

True enough, but Institutional Shareholder Services got it right back in February when they called the arrangement at Facebook “a governance profile with a defense against everything against hubris.” ISS got it wrong when they said the Facebook IPO presented “a Hobson’s choice: accept governance structures which diminish shareholder rights and board accountability, or miss out on what appears to be one of the hottest business models of the internet age.”

Why’s that wrong? Because of the way Zuckerberg has built his company, you aren’t betting on his business when you buy FB. You’re really just betting on him.",Forget the stock price and worry about the company’s dual-class shares.,67.0666666667,0.7333333333000001,3.6666666667000003,high,low,mixed,architecture

Arizona’s biggest city suffered a 55% drop in home prices since the 2006 peak and it consistently ranks among the country’s 20 worst cities in terms of foreclosures. Yet a recent rebound in home sales — and more modestly in home prices — has spurred talk of a recovery there.

Turns out that budding rebound extends out into overall construction, too. In 2011, the Phoenix metro area welcomed a 41% increase in new construction, totaling $5.3 billion in new starts for both residential and non-residential building projects. “In the case of markets that were categorized by the housing boom and bust, that [construction] correction has already occurred,” explains Robert Murray, vice president of economic affairs at McGraw-Hill Construction, a New York City-based construction data firm. “Now areas like Phoenix are in the process of seeing an upturn in new structures – that aren’t even necessarily housing.”In Phoenix, that construction spending jump comes in part from a new $5 billion Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility for which $1.5 billion worth of building began last year. The up-and-coming facility, located outside of city limits in nearby Chandler, Ariz., helped thrust the Phoenix Metropolitan Statistical Area into the No. 8 spot on Forbes’ list of the American Cities with the Most New Construction.

To compile our list, the folks at McGraw-Hill Construction sorted through building data for the nation’s Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) to find the 20 places where the most money was spent on new construction in 2011. MSAs, geographic entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, include the cities for which they are named as well as the surrounding suburbs. We looked at the dollar amount of new construction starts, or projects where ground has been broken and work begun, for structures that fall under the “Total Building” umbrella. Total Building includes single-family home construction, multi-family home construction, office space, retail space, warehouses, healthcare facilities, educational buildings, manufacturing plants and research facilities. We did not include money spent on public works projects such as bridges, streets and parks, nor did we include electric utility construction.

We honed in on construction starts because they are a leading indicator of economic activity and one that is commonly used by builders, developers and economists. Even so, it’s worth noting that tracking construction by starts is hardly foolproof, as work can begin on a project and still stall–if a developer loses their financing, for instance. “There were a substantial number of projects deferred in 2008 and 2009 but those cases are much less so today, looking at 2010, 2011, and now in 2012,” asserts Murray.

Also worth noting: at the metro area level, spending can fluctuate from year-to-year. Mega developments (like the new Intel facility) can run the risk of creating annual spikes in local spending numbers. (Note: If the new facility had not broken ground last year, Phoenix would still have made our top 20 cities list.) “Metro areas can bounce around a bit…but there are going to be more pluses than minuses in 2012 – just very small in scope,” cautions Murray.

Construction activity in nearly every market across the country took a nose dive with the economic downturn. It has remained moribund since, thanks to an overhang of vacant inventory, a weak jobs market, and the fact that in many cases, banks have balked at loaning to residential and commercial builders. New construction projects totaled $421.4 billion in 2011, down nearly 40% from the $689.3 billion logged during the 2006 peak. Even so McGraw-Hill Construction projects a 7% national increase in new construction for 2012.

Coastal cities fare the best in terms of new projects. New York City lands No. 1 on our list, with $17.2 billion’ worth of new construction in 2011. New York is home to one of the country’s biggest construction projects, the 16-acre, seven tower World Trade Center site that has bolstered Big Apple construction spending for years now. But last year it was joined by another large site, Gotham West, a massive $520 million residential project on Manhattan’s Far West Side slated for completion in 2014. The neighborhood will continue to rack up construction spending into 2012 and beyond too, since Hudson Yards, the $12 billion mega development a few blocks away is slated for the first phase of ground-breaking later this year.

“New York was, to some extent, able to buck the recession given some very large projects that had reached the construction start stage,” says Murray, noting that construction of multifamily buildings has accounted for much of the Big Apple’s activity.

Most of our list is comprised of coastal cities, including Boston, Mass. (No. 6), Los Angeles, Calif. (No. 7), Seattle, Wash. (No. 9), and Atlanta (No. 10).

Another state welcoming new building is Texas. The Lone Star state accounts for three cities on our list: Dallas (No. 2), Houston (No. 3), and San Antonio (tied for No. 15). “Texas metro areas are drawing some benefit from the energy sector,” explains Murray. Dallas logged $9.5 billion in new starts last year and McGraw-Hill projects a 9% increase in 2012; Houston logged $8.8 billion, with an 8% increase expected in 2012. San Antonio welcomed $3.3 billion in new starts in 2011 and the same level of spending is expected this year.","The coasts are hot, but—surprise!--hard-hit Phoenix is also on the move.",65.2941176471,0.7058823529,0.7058823529,high,low,abstractive,architecture

It’s an excellent question because Glen’s name hasn’t been mentioned once since Lin-sanity began about 10 days ago.

Who is Glen Grunwald? The fact that you’re asking that says something about the New York Knicks’ General Manager and the low profile he keeps.

However, Glen is responsible for picking up Jeremy Lin from the trash-pile at the end of December, after he’d already been waived by the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets. Glen supported Donnie Walsh in bringing Amar’e Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony to the Knicks last year. Glen’s also directly responsible for signing Tyson Chandler, Steve Novak and Landry Fields who have been key cogs in the recent Knicks’ win streak.

There could be other moves that Grunwald could make in the coming weeks, but – right now – it looks like Grunwald will take NBA Executive of the Year in a walk.

But Glen Grunwald – it turns out – has a personal history that’s very similar to Jeremy Lin’s. Glen has been loved and he has been hated by fans during his career. This all hinged on whether his teams were winning or not. However, Glen has always been smart, kind, and extremely hard-working. Like Lin, Glen never let others’ beliefs’ about him define who he was. Perhaps that’s why he was able to spot a diamond in the rough like Jeremy when he came available.

The first thing you notice about Glen is his height. He’s close to 7 feet. He was an All-American from Chicago who went on to play with Isiah Thomas at Indiana. In fact, Glen was the captain of the 1981 national championship team. Although he was drafted by the Celtics, he never played pro basketball. He had bad knees.

That injury focused Glen to go back to school to figure out what to do with the rest of his life. He got an MBA and law degree and began to work as a corporate attorney, where he began to get sports teams as clients.

After working for the Denver Nuggets organization, Glen got a call from Isiah Thomas in late 90s to come and work for the Toronto Raptors. Thomas was a part-owner at the time and asked Glen to be assistant GM. When Isiah left after a stormy tenure where he didn’t gain majority control of the club, Glen was promoted to GM by the Raptors owners. He’d won them over, even though he was an unknown at the time. They didn’t see him as “Isiah’s guy.”

During Glen’s tenure as GM, he orchestrated the draft-day trade to bring in Vince Carter and he also drafted Tracy McGrady and Chris Bosh. The Raptors came within one game from going to the Eastern Conference finals in 2001.

Yet, 3 short years later, Glen was fired by the Raptors. There were injuries. McGrady wouldn’t re-sign because he wanted to go to a team where he’d be the star. The Raptors didn’t win the LeBron James (or Dwayne Wade) lottery and had to “settle” for Bosh. Carter got older and never reclaimed his success he enjoyed in 2001 for the rest of his career.

None of these things was Glen’s fault. He was just the same smart executive that he’d always been. Yet, I remember being in Toronto at the time and listening to the Raptors’ fans calling in to Sports Talk Radio. They hated Glen. They wanted him escorted out of the city. Wins were all that mattered and Glen wasn’t winning anymore. Raptors’ management agreed (although they complimented Glen greatly as they fired him).",It turns out that the architect of Lin-sanity - Glen Grunwald - has a lot of parallels in his career with Jeremy Lin.,28.8846153846,0.8846153846,1.6538461538,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

It’s unclear from the initial Securities and Exchange Commission fillings what valuation the Empire State Building Trust will seek or how many shares it’ll offer. It will now be at least three to four months before it begins trading, and the SEC will commence a review of the REIT’s fillings.

In the nine months up to Sept. 30, the REIT booked a $73.4 million in operating income from the Empire State Building.

Malkin took control of the Empire State Building in 2002 and embarked on a renovation. The trust expects the Empire State Building makeover to “substantially” finish by 2016, after a further investment of $55 to $65 million funded by cash flow and borrowing.

The renovation on the Empire State Building alone has been extensive: new lobbies, elevators, bathrooms, and windows–even sprucing up the iconic facade. Malkin also consolidated smaller office into larger blocks to lure new clients. “These improvements are designed to improve the overall value and attractiveness of our properties and have contributed significantly to our tenant repositioning efforts,” the trust said in its SEC fillings.

Aside from the Empire State Building, the trust owns six other Manhattan properties, along with five others in Connecticut and immediately outside Manhattan, in Westchester County, according to the SEC fillings. Together, the REIT manages 7.7 million square feet of space, including 5.8 million in New York. 79.9% of its New York space is currently leased. The REIT also has the option to acquire two more Manhattan properties, adding another 1.4 million square feet.

Through the nine months until Sept. 30, the trust earned $34.2 million, slightly down from a year ago, and $126.8 in revenue.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, and Goldmand Sachs are the IPO’s underwriters.

By Jed Kolko, Trulia’s Chief Economist

The housing bust brought construction nearly to a halt. Construction permits, starts, completions and new-home sales are now a small fraction of their high levels during the mid-2000’s boom. They’re now low even relative to their more “normal” pre-boom levels of the mid-1990’s and early-2000’s.

The construction slowdown means two things:

How far has construction activity fallen? New construction permits in the first three quarters of 2011 – January to September — are running at the same low annual pace as in 2009 and 2010, and less than a third of the levels of 2002-2006.

But housing markets are local, and new construction is no exception. Of course, larger metro areas will tend to have more permits for new housing construction just because they’re bigger, so let’s look at new units permitted from July to September 2011 per thousand existing housing units. The most construction-permitting activity, among large metros, is in Texas, which has had strong recent job growth and far-from-the-worst home price declines during the bust. Houston and Dallas top the list for new construction permits, and Austin, San Antonio and Fort Worth are also among the top twenty large metros. Construction is gearing up in Southern cities like Raleigh, Charleston SC and Charlotte too, but not Florida: no metro in Florida or the other high-foreclosure states of California, Nevada or Arizona makes this list.

Top Metros by Construction Permitting Activity, Q3 2011

(Shown are the top 20 metros, ranked by new units permitted per thousand exist units, out of the 84 largest metro areas in the US. Source: Trulia analysis of Census construction permit data, available here.)

Houston, in fact, is almost back to normal construction permitting activity. Permits there in 2011 Q3 are only a little below Houston’s average rate for 1990-2010; same for Dallas, Omaha and San Antonio. Construction permitting was actually above the average historical 20-year rate in Honolulu and San Francisco – even though in San Francisco that historical average is pretty low to begin with: hills, regulation, and not much available land make building tricky in the Bay Area. That’s a huge difference from the national picture: for the US overall, permitting activity in 2011 Q3 is below half the 1990-2010 average rate.

Rising rents, lower rental vacancies and lower homeownership are all telling builders to focus on multi-family construction and take advantage of rental demand. Multifamily accounts for more than half of new construction activity in Dallas and Honolulu. But multi-family is only a sliver of the action in the Carolina metros of Raleigh, Charleston SC and Columbia SC, where almost all new construction is single-family homes, unlike in higher-density cities with bigger shares of renters.

At the other extreme, there’s almost no permitting activity in Detroit, Long Island NY, Orange County CA and Providence RI, where there’s fewer than 0.5 new permits per thousand existing units. In these places, construction is held back by slow-growing (Providence, Long Island) or declining (Detroit) populations or by already-high densities and building restrictions that leave fewer options for new construction (Orange County, CA). There, as well as in Milwaukee, Chicago, Miami and much of the rest of Florida and California, construction is slow relative to the overall housing stock and relative to normal levels.

Why are builders digging in some metros and sitting out in others? The best predictor of construction permitting activity is population growth, and Raleigh and Austin – where permitting is high – were among the fastest growing large metros over the past 10 years. Home price increases – or less horrific declines – and lower vacancy rates also signal to builders that demand is stirring; high vacancies and big price drops in Florida, the Southwest and inland California hold back construction there.","By Jed Kolko, Trulia's Chief Economist The housing bust brought construction nearly to a halt. Construction permits, starts, completions and new-home sales are now a small fraction of their high levels during the mid-2000’s boom. They’re now low even relative to their more “normal” pre-boom levels of the mid-1990’s and early-2000’s. The [...]",10.7083333333,0.9444444444000001,50.4166666667,low,high,extractive,architecture

By any measure, our infrastructure is old and decaying. According to Reuters, the U.S. spends only about two percent of GDP on infrastructure, which is half of what it spent 50 years ago, and a recent report from the World Economic Forum ranks America’s infrastructure 16th in the world, when it was 6th just four years ago.

Shame on us for not making investments in the physical structure our children will inherit. Certainly, China and other competitors are rapidly developing new roads, airports and structure for basic utilities. As our national roof continues to leak, we debate what kind of steak we will eat.

America has been number one for so long that we have forgotten about humility, sacrifice and investment. The American generations before us understood these attributes, and their hard work and delayed gratification gave us the long-lasting infrastructure and great lifestyle we enjoy today.

To be fair, our uncontrollable budget deficit is impeding public works spending. But we don’t need to trade spending restraint for better bridges and roads. We can do both at the same time.

Instead, some, including President Obama, are suggesting creating a privately funded national infrastructure bank. Under this concept, government would create the bank and funding structure that would encourage private investments.

Democrats like the idea because it improves our crumbling infrastructure while also creating jobs for union workers (using the Davis-Bacon “prevailing wage” provisions). Republicans are skeptical, especially about government loan guarantees, pork barrel projects and mandating higher priced union labor.

As the Politico reports, rumors are that Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) is crafting a clever compromise. It would allow the one trillion dollars U.S. companies have parked overseas to be “repatriated” if a portion was invested in an infrastructure bank. This money is now being invested overseas because high U.S. tax rates discourage returning it. Everyone would like to see a large portion returned to the United States to help kick-start our economy and create jobs.

Senator Schumer has an innovative idea. If he can create an infrastructure bank that is run efficiently and chooses worthwhile projects – and relax the requirement for high-priced union workers – it may be possible to kick-start the bank without government spending money or creating a new liability.

Any American innovation strategy assumes a functioning infrastructure and we need innovative ideas to rebuild our infrastructure. This can and should be a bipartisan effort which will create jobs today and invest in our children’s future.

Keep at it, Senator Schumer!

Former Time Warner CEO Jerry Levin will serve as chairperson of StartUp Health, a public-private partnership that’s similar to (and working with) Startup America, chaired by AOL’s former CEO Steve Case.

“Not enough people are being incentivized to go into health and wellness space,” says Jerry Levin.”We’ll take the linkage from the government and corporations to build a platform for entrepreneurs to get financing and mentorship.”

StartUp Health formally launched today and will partner with the Department of Health and Human Services. Similar to Startup America, it’s unclear exactly what the government’s role will be and whether it’s largely symbolic. Levin says his team at StartUp Health will convene series of roundtables with entrepreneurs, government agencies and investors to create a roadmap for building this platform for Health 2.0 companies.

Levin has been a board chairman and investor in one startup in the consumer health space, OrganizedWisdom.com that aims to be WebMD 2.o or a site where patients, doctors, and advisors can convene with questions and answers about specific health problems. Organizedwisdom.com is also a partner organization in Startup Health and the company’s CEO Steve Krein says it will open up its website to developers who are interested in building APIs or software program on its existing universe of information on consumer health problems.

“The Internet is a destructive technology,” says Levin. “I’ve spent a lifetime seeing it transform and disrupt the media business, but why hasn’t there been that disruption taking place in terms of health and wellness?” Unlike the consumer web space, the health care universe clearly has a wide range of legal barriers to innovation as well as institutional inertia. The public-private partnership of StartUp Health could at the very least start the conversation of how these barriers could be circumvented or altered if government is willing to listen.

Here’s more from a recent conversation I had with Levin and Steven Krein on Health 2.0 and Organizedwisdom.com.

Chapter One: Trade a job title for a brand.

Katie Couric, the No. 22 Forbes 100 Most Powerful Women In The World, is leaving her post. The other Waitie Katie (as in “When is my contract up?”) is leaving her anchor job at CBS Evening News. Are there still some balloons floating around the CBS offices from the original announcement of the nation’s first female network news anchor back in 2006?

Not quite five years later, it’s not such a biggie that she’s quitting, right?, what with Diane Sawyer, Christiane Amanpour and Rachel Maddow in place.

While nightly news shows are steadily slipping in relevance, think of the just-released Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Their findings? Women make up just 23% of top-level media management. Women’s voices at the highest levels of network news may falling onto an aging, shrinking demographic, but it does make a difference just the same in terms of what stories are covered and how.

Couric is said to be in talks to launch a syndicated talk show in 2012. While broadcast news anchors generally draw 50-50ish percentage of men and women viewers, chat fests, with mostly female audiences, are a proven pipeline to something altogether different from a job title. By going into a syndicated talk show she signaling she wants to be something more: a brand.

She is prepped to go the route of Oprah, Ellen and Martha. Her move also mirrors the career playbook of Sarah Palin, the Alaska governor-turned-VP-candidate-turned-pundit-author-reality-TV-host who really didn’t want to be a job title, either. (Palin, notably, has held onto a healthy audience of men who like to watch.)

Couric’s first stops on the brandwagon have been happening for a while. When I spoke with her last summer for the Power Women list, she ticked off a list of new projects that served to exposure the “Katie” brand in “this fractured media environment:” blogging on Huffington Post, power tweeting (174K followers) and airing her own Web show, @katiecouric.

Here’s a sample of an upcoming New York Times Magazine interview with Couric–and perhaps a taste of the tone and tenor of her talk show:

NYT: Have you thought about what you’ll do? Give stuff away like Oprah? Dance around like Ellen?

Couric: Are you saying you’re not a big fan of syndication?

No! My wife has forced me to love Oprah for years. I’m just asking what your show would be known for.","Katie Couric is leaving the CBS Nightly News for a talk show.

The government's new plan to build a series of ""eco-towns"" with Japanese assistance belatedly acknowledges the importance of the urban environment, and also signals the deepening involvement of Japanese companies in India's infrastructure development.

The government has signed contracts with a group of Japanese companies for pilot projects leading to the development of new eco-friendly towns. The group includes Hitachi ( HIT - news - people ), Mitsubishi, Toshiba ( TOSBF.PK - news - people ), Tokyo Electric Power and JGC. The pilot schemes initially follow the route of the new Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) between Mumbai and Delhi. The towns will be modeled on Japan's own Kitakyushu Eco-Town, designed with integrated transport systems and for low energy-usage, minimizing pollution and maximizing recycling. Each pilot scheme is to cost an estimated $10 billion.

Urban Neglect The initiative follows decades of neglect, during which ruling ideologies turned away from urban growth to favor the rural economy and keeping the peasantry on the land. Urban expansion has been largely unplanned and thus unable to draw on public resources for infrastructure.

--Institutions. Until 1992 India did not even have a Ministry of Urban Development. One-third of the current urban population is estimated to live in shanties and huts. The present five-year plan (2007-2012) calculates that India's cities are short of 23 million residential units, especially for low-income families.

--Infrastructure. Water and sewage services are inadequate. Several ""colonies"" that grew up around the edges of Delhi have been abandoned for lack of water connections, and much of Bangalore is subject to water rationing during the dry season.

--Transport. While integrated metro systems have been under consideration for many years, they have been slow to develop. Only Delhi can boast an extensive metro-rail network.

--Illegality. A series of interventions by the Supreme Court has revealed the extent of unplanned urban sprawl. In Delhi it has closed down 150,000 illegal industrial enterprises, cleared the streets of tens of thousands of illegal encroachments, torn down houses and ordered the termination of illegal water connections to ""colonies.""

Vision of the Future The issue of urban planning has now come to the fore, not least through the Supreme Court's caustic rulings. As well as showing increased political will to address the problem, the eco-towns initiative represents a significant change in attitudes toward urban India. Moreover, it is significant that the pilot schemes should be situated along the DFC and involve Japanese finance and engineering.

--Corridor scheme. The DFC has been widely seen as a vanguard enterprise carrying India toward a new stage of industrial development. Its intention is not merely to move goods faster between the country's two largest metropolitan areas, but also, along the way, to promote a string of new industries and towns, taking advantage of the improved transport system. Eventually the DFC would mark an 800-kilometer belt of manufacturing and commercial enterprise.","City planning has come to the fore, with help from Japanese companies, though urbanization is not without detractors.",27.5238095238,0.7142857143,1.9523809524,medium,low,mixed,architecture

All of these threaten to derail, destroy or bankrupt businesses around the world. Businesses that can't afford to rebuild if they are destroyed, or stay profitable as energy prices rise while the global economy sinks. In today's environment businesses can no longer wait for governments to help shape solutions to deal with climate change.

Video: Keys To Green Building

No matter how large or small a business is, business leaders must consider the work environment. Applying certain principles of sustainability can lead to dramatic savings that also improve a company's performance from an environmental and social perspective. Following are seven strategies to help businesses make a difference:

Amid economic uncertainty, many companies are downsizing, consolidating office or production space or looking at new facilities that will provide operational and maintenance savings in the long term. This provides the ideal opportunity to integrate elements of sustainable design and can lead to dramatic environmental health and cost savings. Energy costs for renovated existing facilities or new buildings can easily be reduced by 50% from previous levels.

2) Set Green Building Performance Goals

Setting initial green building performance goals for a renovation project or new site can help a company track and benchmark its performance. The U.S. Green Building Council's LEED® Green Building Rating System and the International Living Building Institute's Living Building Challenge are two commonly accepted tools available for businesses to benchmark their building and interior space performance.

3) Reduce Equipment and Load Requirements

In designing a new space or the renovation of an existing space, first consider solutions to reduce equipment and energy load requirements. Excessive building glazing can lead to discomfort in summer heat and can drive up air conditioning costs. Improve the quality of the building envelope--the space between the outer and inner walls--with insulation. Employ simple design strategies that include the use of natural daylight, ventilation and sun-mitigating measures such as interior blinds or external louvers to minimize air-conditioning needs. Together these can reduce energy use by 10%-20%.",Incorporating sustainable design is good for both the bottom line and employee morale.,28.4285714286,0.5,0.6428571429000001,medium,low,abstractive,architecture

Analysts adjusted their forecasts accordingly and the home builders shares traded up on Friday while most of its peers were in the red.

Before the opening bell Beazer ( BZH - news - people ) said it earned $48 million, or $1.17 per share, in its first quarter of fiscal-year 2010, easily beating analysts' consensus call for a loss of $39.8 million, or 90 cents per share. Analysts typically exclude one-time items such as the tax gain when forecasting earnings estimates. In the year-earlier period Beazer lost $80.3 million, or $2.08 per share.

Beazer benefited from a quarterly income tax benefit of $101 million related to the Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009 which was enacted in the recent quarter.

UBS analyst David Goldberg noted that Beazers outperformance was driven by the lower charges. The refund, coupled with strategic steps taken by Beazer management since the end of the quarter, should significantly ease financial constraints into the second half of 2010.

Goldberg now expects Beazer to earn $2.30 per share this year, up from his prior forecast of $2.10. We believe the focus on profitability could drive upside surprise, he said, but maintained his Neutral rating on Beazers shares and a price target of $4.50.

Orders for new homes increased 37% compared to year-ago levels as homebuyers took advantage of low mortgage rates and federal tax credits. Chief executive Ian J. McCarthy said he was ""encouraged by the improvement in our new home sales.""

Last month, the Commerce Department reported that construction of new homes and apartments fell 4% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 557,000. That was lower than the expected 580,000 starts. While construction dipped, applications for new building permits, which help measure future construction activity, rose 11% in December, to 653,000. The figure topped economists predictions for construction applications, and approached activity levels not seen since 2008. The fact remains that housing is still the weak link in the economy, noted BMO Capital Markets analyst Jennifer Lee. (See Permits To Pave The Way For Home Builders.)

Beazer shares seesawed Friday before closing up 1.2% to $4.16.

The bullish sentiment did not extend to fellow builders. The S&P Supercomposite Home Builder Index fell 2.2% to close at $264.81, and the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ( XHB - news - people ), an exchange-traded fund holding home builder stocks, traded .9% lower to close at $15.05 on Friday.

At the end of 2009, Beazers unsold finished homes totaled 291, 42.1% fewer than it had at the end of 2008. Atlanta-based Beazer is one of several builders to report a quarterly profit and improved home orders for the last three months of 2009.

Earlier this week rival home builder D.R. Horton ( DHI - news - people ) said it earned $192 million, or 56 cents per share, in its fiscal first quarter, beating estimates, also thanks largely to a hefty tax gain. The Fort Worth, Tex.-based home builder said the number of new orders and completed sales increased significantly in the quarter, compared with the first quarter last year. (See ""D.R. Horton Profit Pumps Up Home Builders."")

D.R. Horton shares closed down 4.1% to $12.67. Elsewhere in the sector, Lennar ( LEN - news - people ) shares lost 4.1% to $14.71 and Toll Brothers ( TOL - news - people ) fell .9% to $18.65. Meritage Homes ( MTH - news - people ) finished 2.3% lower at $22.12.

Congress recently extended the deadline for a federal tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time homebuyers, and expanded it to include a credit of $6,500 for repeat buyers. Beazer caters to first-time homebuyers.

The tax credit for home buyers was set to expire at the end of November. Sales of existing homes got a big bump over the summer as people rushed to make the deadline before falling back to their level of early 2009. Many industry experts question whether the fragile housing recovery will fall back again once the tax credits expire at the end of April.

The credit worked better than expected, but that is not such a good thing, as it may have prompted home purchases in the second half of 2009 that cannibalized potential sales this year. People who would have put off buying accelerated their plans to take advantage of the federal money. (See ""Housing Handout."")

We are planning for a softer second half of the year, but hoping for something better,"" said Beazer CEO McCarthy, who also said sales may not necessarily slow after the tax credit expires as long as home prices remain stable and unemployment continues to decline. (See Street Slips On Nonfarm Payrolls, Oil and Kelly Surges On Temp Hiring.)

Beazer CEO McCarthy cautioned that ""it is premature to signal the beginning of a sustainable recovery in the housing market,"" adding that ""we are seeing indications that historically high levels of home affordability, home price stability, low mortgage interest rates and home buyer tax credits may be beginning to balance out prospective home buyers' concerns about falling home prices, foreclosures and risk of job loss in most of our markets.""

The home building industry has taken a severe beating since the subprime mortgage meltdown in the fall of 2008, which led to a credit crisis and economic recession.

For the last three months of 2009 Beazer reported a 27% decline in the number of buyers who backed out of contracts, compared with 46% at the end of 2008. The figure indicates that shopper confidence is beginning to rebound. Beazer and other home builders often begin construction on homes before they have a buyer, so Wall Street watches them for trends in the housing market.

Earlier this week, the National Association of Realtor's pending home sales index, which tallies the number of contracts signed by people preparing to buy a home, rose 1% in December to 96.6, narrowly missing economists' estimates for a reading of 97.1. The index is a key indicator for home sales expected to be completed over the first few months of 2010. The uptick is a sign that home sales could be stabilizing heading into the spring home-buying season.",Home builder's Q1 beat boosted shares Friday while sector peers were in negative territory.,76.8125,0.6875,1.3125,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Remember those reports of Chinese and Russian attacks on the U.S. electrical grid? I say they never happened--nothing, nada, zip.

What's more, the real threats to the U.S. power grid aren't spies and hackers, but a combination of decades of post-deregulation underinvestment and legions of ""nimbys"" who block attempts to upgrade the aging system.

The stories gained currency last week, complete with Hollywood-friendly but improbable details like the pieces of ""sleeper"" software that were said to have been left behind in the electrical system by China and Russia to be re-awakened in the event of a war.

I am not the only one who thought the story was too lurid to be true; experts in the electrical grid were skeptical as well. Gregory Reed, director of the Power and Energy Initiative at the University of Pittsburgh and an expert in the system, said that during a conference call with grid experts on April 14 there was nearly uniform derision about the report.

One red flag about the story's accuracy, Reed said, was how thinly it was sourced. There was a complete absence of concrete details about what happened, and there was not even a single on-the-record quote from a government or industry official saying unequivocally that something had in fact taken place.

This is not to say that the U.S. electrical system is necessarily in fine fettle, Reed said, or that there aren't isolated cases in which the system hasn't been tampered with remotely, notably by disgruntled ex-employees. ""Are we exposed to some things? Sure. We always need to be more vigilant,"" he said. ""But there is no need to scare the public about our power grid being hacked into when that almost certainly isn't happening.""

Reed notes that there is a very large group of people in the country with intimate daily knowledge of the electrical system, not just at utility and transmission companies, but also in academia and among state and federal regulators. Were there to be any significant attack on the power grid, it wouldn't be something kept secret and only whispered about by a few in-the-know spy chasers. ""We would all be aware that something had taken place,"" Reed said.

Indeed, the tales of Chinese and Russian electricity hackers are better explained by three of the behind-the-scenes dynamics of journalism than by anything having to do with the electrical grid.

One is that an American reporter never gets into trouble for saying something harsh about Russia or China. Those two governments will naturally deny any accusations, but the denials are treated as pro forma announcements from guilty parties.

The second is that neither utility companies nor utility regulators ever wants to completely deny a story like this, lest they appear naïve or unvigilant. There is thus no incentive for anyone to say the equivalent of, ""Move along, nothing to see hear.""

The third is that editors love stories with the word ""hacker"" in it. Mix in ""Communists"" and ""spies,"" and editors are in heaven. Naturally, officials of Web security companies are always happy to provide quotes about the danger we are facing, whether or not they actually know anything about the transformers, relays, circuit breakers and the like of the electrical grid.

The truth, as always, is vastly more prosaic. For starters, most of the U.S. power system is too antiquated to even be on the Internet in the first place. In addition, Reed notes that since deregulation in the 1980s, investment in the grid has waned, to the point where it has ceased keeping up with our power needs.

The Obama administration, he said, is the first administration to notice this and has set aside funds to bring the grid into the 21st century. Those efforts, though, have often been blocked by neighborhood activists who don't like new power lines either because of aesthetic concerns, or because of largely discredited fears that they might be a threat to health.

But that is a story that is seldom told; too bad the nimbys aren't from Moscow or Beijing.

Cemex said the lower forecast included the impact of acquiring building materials company Rinker Group (nyse: RIN - news - people ), as well as the sale of some U.S. assets to its joint venture Ready Mix USA, as well as the confiscation of its Venezuelan assets as of Aug. 1. The company said its compensation for the nationalization of its assets has not yet been determined.

Last month the Venezuelan government seized control of cement plants owned by Cemex after the countrys largest cement producer failed to reach a deal on compensation for the nationalization of its operations. (See  Cemex Packs Its Bags.)

We continue to face a challenging economic environment in most of our markets, said Rodrigo Trevino, the companys chief financial officer. The downturn in the housing and construction markets in the United Spain has hurt Cemex, as well as turmoil in its markets in the Britain and Spain. The depreciation of the Mexican peso since the end of the second quarter has also cut into the companys full-year estimates, Trevino said.

The company has been able to partially offset significant energy and transportation costs with cost-cutting. Increased prices also helped to offset inflation.

Cemex forecast full-year EBITDA of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion in 2008, down from an earlier $5.3 billion estimate.

Cemex increased its U.S. market share just as the subprime mortgage crisis hit, taking over Australia's Rinker -- with 80.0% of its operations in the United States -- last year for about $14.3 billion.

The dour outlook at Cemex did not affect other major building-supply companies on Friday. Lafarge rose 1.4%, or 41 cents, to $28.81 at the close, while Texas Industries (nyse: TXI - news - people ) inched up 0.5%, or 23 cents, to $47.20.

Then he reorganized. In a move to continue his modernization of the century-old conglomerate, General Electric (nyse: GE - news - people ) Immelt, the firm's chief executive, announced Friday that the company's structure will now consist of four businesses down from six. When he took over in 2001, there were 11 different segments under his auspices.

In May, he announced plans to divest the company's original division, which makes the electrical goods from which it takes its name (See ""Appliances A Washout At GE"") and a deal to sell the plastics operations to Saudi Basic Industries. (See ""Saudis Buying GE Plastics"")

On Friday, Immelt said the change in structure will  best utilize our strong leadership team while maximizing synergy and execution. The announcement didn't move investors. GE didn't gain or lose a penny during trading in New York, ending unchanged at $28.71.

Immelt is obviously casting about for ways to boost the company's stock price. Since he took over seven years ago, GE shares have declined 29.8%, from $40.90, despite earnings that have risen every year save 2003. In 2000, GE cost more than 37 times its earnings per share, but investors are now only willing to pay 13.5 times.

One reason: the company's financial operations, which account for nearly 40.0% of the business, are difficult to understand, and the new plan will group them all together. Even if this does not clarify exactly what it is GE does, it will make it easier to understand the rest of the company. Jeffrey DeMarrais, a spokesperson for the company, told Forbes.com via email that GE is, at its core, an infrastructure, finance and media company. The new structure reflects that. Infrastructure was split into two divisions. Infrastructure Energy will merge gas, oil and water technologies and Infrastructure Technology will include healthcare, aviation and transportation. NBC Universal, the television network and film studio that was created when GE bought Vivendi's entertainment assets and merged them with its own, leaving the French firm a 20.0% stake, remained unchanged. GE Capital will group the company's mysterious financial divisions, including units that were once part of the infrastructure operations.

DeMarrais said, Bringing the financial businesses back together into GE Capital not only helps improve those business' ability to compete, but makes it easier for investors to understand the company. In 2007, the two infrastructure businesses represented 47.0% of GEs revenue, or $73 billion. GE Capital represented 38.0% of revenue, or $66 billion, and NBC Universal pulled in roughly 10.0%, or $15.4 billion. Infrastructure carried GE during the second quarter.

While Google always keeps the exact details of its updates under tight wraps, experts in the industry can make reasonable assumptions about the nature of each change based on information provided through public updates and details found in recent patents.

One of the most recent patents filed in March of 2014 has been tied to Google’s Panda algorithm, and specialists everywhere have been trying to decipher exactly what it means for companies trying to improve their search engine ranks. Overall trends in the world of SEO have indicated an increasing favor for high-quality content strategies, and it looks like this trend will continue—but link building is still important because inbound links remain the most important factor in Google’s ranking algorithm. Combining content marketing with link building was the subject of my article, “The Two Things You Need to Boost Your Search Results.”

But the way Google defines a link is changing; the way Google views and uses links in its ranking algorithms is undergoing a major shift which could impact the search visibility of every site on the Web.

The Problem with “Authority” and Old-School Link Building

In order to rank highly for a search query, your site needs a high level of “authority,” an abstract and subjective term for how credible and influential your site is compared to others in your industry. Many SEO companies have defined this differently, calling it “domain authority” or “brand authority,” and have calculated a number on an arbitrary scale to measure how much relative “authority” a given site has at any given point in time.

In theory, authority is a brilliant way to determine how highly a site should rank in a search engine results page. Search engines want to give users the most relevant, trustworthy content possible, and using authority as a primary determining value is a surefire way to give people authoritative content. The problem, of course, is that authority is subjective (some would say incalculable), and using a mathematic algorithm to define it will lead to unpredictable results and numerous strategic holes that can be exploited.

Link building, as a tactic, rose to prominence because having more links pointing to your site once meant instantly having a higher authority. Since Google caught on to these “black hat” schemes, those old school link building tactics are now harmful to your authority. Instead, modern link builders are careful to ensure links appear natural, from a diverse range of sources, and preferably those with high authority already.

But even this approach may no longer be enough to serve as a viable link building strategy, especially in the long term. From the latest information we have, it appears as though Google is changing the way it looks at links entirely, closing the door on some link building strategies while opening a door for new ones to develop.

Reference Queries and Implied Links

“Links” used to mean explicitly posted URLs that lead back to a page on your website. They could be posted in full, like https://www.google.com/, or be embedded as hyperlink anchor text, like Google. Either way, a link was a link, and the more links you had, the better. As you can imagine, this led to a lot of people spamming links to their own pages with reckless abandon, polluting the web with self-serving fluff and compromising the entire authority system used by Google’s algorithm.

Now, as outlined in the recent Panda patent, Google is differentiating between what it identifies as “express links,” or conventional links, and “implied links.” Implied links are references or mentions of a brand and/or website without an explicit link. These references could be in the body of a blog post, citing out another brand’s expertise on a specific subject, in a comment referring to another brand’s coverage of a topic, or in some other form so long as the site’s name is specifically mentioned.

Implied links, also called “brand mentions” or simply “mentions,” are becoming relevant to brand authority in new ways, calling the entire link building system into question and demonstrating another major technological breakthrough in the sophistication of Google’s measurement of authority.

Adding to this complexity in calculating authority, Google appears to also be placing a higher emphasis on what it identifies as “reference queries.” Reference queries are historical instances of individuals using a specific query and ending up in a specific location—giving Google some indication of whether a given site offers what a user is searching for. Reference queries help build an understanding of a site’s popularity (or authority) compared to similar results for a given query. In other words, the better your site is at giving people what they’re looking for, the better you’ll rank for relevant searches.

It’s clear that brand mentions are becoming very important to a site’s authority, but it appears as though traditional links are not obsolete. Both express links and implied links are now used to calculate authority, so it’s important to include both in your link building strategy. Even though, as of now, there is no precise ratio of links to mentions that has been demonstrated to be ideal for building your authority, here are a few thoughts to consider as you split your link building strategy between express links and implied links:

While it would be easy to purchase brand mentions the same way many companies purchase external links now, the better long-term strategy looks to be producing high quality content that can facilitate both links and mentions on its own. As described in 10 Reasons Your Content Strategy is More Important than Link Building, a solid content strategy has far more long-term potential and immediate value than any gimmick that relies on taking advantage of a perceived hole in the system.

Part of a building collapsed in New York's Midtown Manhattan Friday, killing at least one person and seriously wounding another, officials confirm to Fox News.

Crews had been demolishing the building to make way for a luxury boutique hotel. The injured worker had been trapped beneath the rubble, officials said, adding that the other victim was found dead on arrival.

The collapse was reported just before 10:30 a.m. Friday at an eight-story building on West 38th Street, the Fire Department of New York said. Fire trucks and ambulances were at the scene, where police had cordoned off the street.

But what exactly collapsed wasn't clear from the street. Scaffolding and netting were still up on the building, and there was no sign of rubble or visible damage.

19 workers were inside the building at the time, according to Fox 5.

According to buildings records, the building is owned by Fortuna LLC. A woman who answered the phone at Fortuna Realty Group's office declined to comment and referred calls to Northeast Service Interiors, a demolition company doing work at the site. Northeast said its owners were at the site and couldn't immediately respond to a telephone call.

According to Fortuna's website, it acquired the property in late 2012 and is planning a 27-story, 170-room luxury boutique hotel there. City Buildings Department records show a permit for full demolition of the existing building was issued in May. It appears some construction has been in the works since then - permits have been issued for sprinkler systems, electrical work and other things.

The buildings department said it was on the scene investigating and didn't yet have details.

Robert Bankston, a demolition contractor who formerly worked on the site, said the two neighboring buildings were sound when the project began.

""It wasn't like the buildings were falling down,"" said Bankston, who noted that demolition needs to be done carefully to avoid creating risks of collapse, such as by overloading floors with heavy debris.

He said his company left the project about a month ago amid a financial disagreement with the general contractor.

At least 60 firefighters responded to the collapse.

(Korean Tourism Organization)

Tourism officials in Taiwan have come up with a new plan to draw in more visitors: sex.

A sex themed park called “Romantic Boulevard,” will be built on a 37-mile stretch of land along the coast that will feature heart-shaped arches, a glass church and a kinky outdoor sculpture garden with erotic figures of people and animals in “various lovemaking positions.” reports the Wall Street Journal.

“We want people to fall in love with Taiwan as well as fall in love while in Taiwan,” Shih Chao-hui, the deputy director of Southwest Coast National Scenic Area Office, told WSJ. His office promotes tourism mainly in agricultural areas of the country, including Yunlin and Tainan.

The proposed park will likely be modeled after the sex themed Jeju Loveland in South Korea, which opened in 2004. Like Jeju, Taiwan’s park will feature racy statues of oversized genitalia and three-somes. Though Romantic Boulevard is still in the early phase of development, the park has already staged a “scenic area” for couples to take wedding portraits. Shih says a whopping 220,000 people visited the site earlier this month.

The announcement of the park has received mixed reviews from locals, with some --including the central government’s Tourism Bureau, concerned that the park will hurt Taiwan's reputation abroad.

But Shih told China Real Time that he's already been inundated with emails from people asking when the park will be open.

“Look, we are in the business of tourism, not education or religion, so the question should be, will the park generate business opportunities and we believe the answer is yes,” said Shih.

Though the Tourism Bureau has yet to announce support for the sex theme park, a representative for the bureau reportedly told reporters that, “Taiwan is a romantic place and we are always looking for creative ways to promote it.”

Shih is currently seeking more investors and said he hopes a hotel will be built next to the park “just in case visitors want turn their feelings into actions.”",“Romantic Boulevard” will appeal to visitors’ sensual sides.,39.0909090909,0.6363636364,1.3636363636,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Two women and a dog have been rescued from the rubble of a Chicago apartment building that collapsed Sunday evening on the city's South Side.

Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said that one of the women, a 78-year-old who lived on an upper floor, was in critical condition at a local hospital, but was also alert and talking. The other woman, who lived below her neighbor, was in fair-to-serious condition at a different hospital. Langford said that the women were the only two people who lived in the building. The rescued dog was identified as a pit bull named Tigger.

The three-year-old, three-story building on South Calumet Avenue, collapsed after an explosion around 7 p.m. local time. Approximately 100 firefighters responded to the scene.

""The whole building is pancaked,"" Langford told the Chicago Tribune.

Local utility Peoples Gas was also on the scene to determine whether a gas explosion caused the collapse. Langford said authorities were working with the utility, but could not immediately confirm the cause. The spokesman added that the person who initially called 911 to report the collapse heard a single large explosion.

Neighbor McKiley Jonkins told the Chicago Sun-Times she saw a flash of light, then heard an explosion.

""Boom. It was the loudest explosion I ever heard,” she said.

The Daily Caller posted the third video Wednesday of the MIT professor, this time speaking at the University of Rhode Island in 2012.

Gruber was discussing the law’s so-called ""Cadillac tax,” which he said was helped along by “hero” then-Sen. John Kerry. The “Cadillac tax” mandates that insurance companies be taxed rather than policy holders. He said that taxing individuals would have been “politically impossible,” but taxing the companies worked because Americans didn't understand the difference.

“So basically it's the same thing,” he said. “We just tax the insurance companies, they pass on higher prices that offsets the tax break we get, it ends up being the same thing. It's a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter.”

The new video follows a second tape played on Fox News' ""The Kelly File” Tuesday that showed Gruber speaking on a similar topic at an October 2013 event at Washington University in St. Louis.

Referring to the ""Cadillac tax,” he said: ""They proposed it and that passed, because the American people are too stupid to understand the difference.""

This was similar to remarks he made at a separate event around the same time in 2013. In a clip of that event, Gruber said the ""lack of transparency"" in the way the law was crafted was critical. ""Basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass,"" he said.

After the first tape surfaced -- prompting Republican outrage -- Gruber went on MSNBC to express regret. On Tuesday, he said: ""I was speaking off the cuff and I basically spoke inappropriately, and I regret having made those comments.""

But after Fox News played the second tape, GOP lawmakers said it proves what they've been saying all along.

""It confirms people's greatest fear about the government,"" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told Fox News on Wednesday. ""Remember, it was Nancy Pelosi who said first you have to pass it before you get to find out what's in it.""

The American School of Oriental Research's Cultural Heritage Initiative posted pictures from the satellite imagery and analytics company DigitalGlobe that show the construction on the edge of the ancient site that was damaged by the Islamic State group, which held Palmyra for 10 months.

Syrian troops backed by Russian airstrikes captured Palmyra in March and fighting continues miles away until this day.

Russian demining experts have detonated hundreds of bombs left behind by the extremists at and near the site since the town was captured. A top Syrian archaeologist said the presence of Syrian and Russian troops in Palmyra is important to prevent ISIS from coming back.

Maamoun Abdulkarim, head of the Antiquities and Museums Department in Damascus, told The Associated Press that the Russians are building small barracks that includes offices and clinics.

Abdulkarim said his organization was not asked for permission but added that ISIS is close to the town and the presence of Russian and Syrian troops is important to ensure that the site remains in government hands.

""We refuse to give permission even if it was for a small room to be built inside the site whether it is for the Syrian army, Russian army or anyone else,"" Abudlkarim said by telephone from Damascus. ""We will never give such permission because this will be in violation of the archaeology law.""

Since Russia began launching airstrikes in Syria in September 2015, Moscow has tipped the balance of power in favor of President Bashar Assad's forces. Earlier this year Russia said it was scaling back its presence in Syria.

Before ISIS captured the town in May 2015, the Syrian army was known to have minor military presence inside the site.

During the Islamic State group's 10 months in Palmyra, the militants destroyed the Temple of Bel, which dated back to A.D. 32, the Temple of Baalshamin, which was several stories high and fronted by six towering columns, and the Arch of Triumph, which was built under the Roman emperor Septimius Severus between A.D. 193 and A.D. 211.

""During the time of war, sometimes archaeological authorities don't have a say but security decisions dictate the orders,"" AbdulKarim said. ""Once the situation improves and peace is reached, then we will openly call for removing"" the barracks.

Osama al-Khatib, a Syrian opposition activist from Palmyra who currently lives in Turkey, said the Russians are setting up prefabricated homes and tents on the northern edge of the archaeological site. He added that the site where the Russians are now based is hundreds of yards from the temples and the Arch of Triumph.

He said there are also some historical graves near where the Russians are setting up their barracks.","The Russian military is constructing a new army base in the central Syrian town of Palmyra, within the protected zone that holds the archaeological site listed by UNESCO as a world heritage site and without asking for permission from relevant authorities, an American heritage organization and a top Syrian archaeologist said Tuesday.",10.2727272727,1.0,55.0,low,high,extractive,architecture

LAGOS, Nigeria – Rescue workers early Tuesday dug a woman out of the rubble of a building that collapsed four days ago and she walked away with only a slight injury, a government spokesman said.

The death toll rose to 60 by Tuesday afternoon from the fallen multistory building serving as a shopping mall and guesthouse at the sprawling campus of televangelist T.B. Joshua's Synagogue, Church of All Nations, on the outskirts of Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, according to spokesman Ibrahim Farinloye of the Nigerian Emergency Management Agency.

""We rescued a woman, alive, around 2 a.m. this morning,"" Farinloye told The Associated Press. ""We found her under the rubble. She walked away with only a little dislocation on her hand. She is very, very lucky.""

He said she appeared middle-aged and was black, but he did not ask her nationality.

Workers have rescued 131 survivors, he said. More than 1,000 rescuers from several agencies are at the scene, he said of the pancaked building that was destroyed in clouds of dust and debris on Friday.

It is not known how many foreigners are among victims at the church that attracted people from around the world to experience the evangelical Joshua's preaching, prophecies and faith healing and to get his blessed water that some say has miraculous powers.

South Africa's government said its diplomats are at the scene since at least five South African church tour groups were there at the time.

In Johannesburg, a man called into Talk Radio 702 to complain that a family member who had gone to the church was missing and that they were unable to get any information from the church or Nigerian government officials. South Africa has set up a hotline for concerned family members.

A woman who answered the telephone at the church would not give her name and said only that ""Everything is under control. That is all you need to know.""

Joshua has tried to implicate Islamic extremists in the building collapse, publishing a video purporting to show a mysterious aircraft flying low over the building four times before the disaster. He told a televised service Sunday that his church has been targeted before by Nigeria's homegrown Boko Haram extremist group. He told congregants that enemies were trying to keep them from his church, but not to worry since he was the main target.

Farinloye, however, said the building appears to have collapsed because of poor construction work. He said workers were trying to build two additional floors onto an existing four-story structure without reinforcing the foundations. Nigeria's construction industry is bedeviled by endemic corruption that sometimes leads contractors to take short cuts and use substandard products that lead building to collapse quite frequently.","Rescue workers early Tuesday dug a woman out of the rubble of a building that collapsed four days ago and she walked away with only a slight injury, a government spokesman said.",29.1176470588,1.0,34.0,medium,high,extractive,architecture

For these students, it's reading, writing and robotic moon landing.

In their free time, most college students join the football squad, debate club or other group (or waste their time at the tap room). Around 80 students at Penn State are still doing those ordinary college activities. But they’re also busy building a moon lander, and hope to blast off before Dec. 31, 2015.

“They’re still college students, they’re still out having fun. We’re still trying to guess who’s dating who,” project leader and NASA veteran Michael Paul told FoxNews.com.

Paul's team from Penn State is the only student-led group competing for the $40 million Google Lunar X Prize, racing teams from Chile, Indonesia, Japan, India and around the globe to beat that December deadline to land a private vehicle on the moon. The X Prize aims to inspire private industry; Paul hopes to inspire students and dreamers.

- Michael Paul, Penn State Lunar Lion team leader

“It’s to get this into the hands of students, to excite this generation as well as the generations to follow,” he said. “For so long people have been asking what happened to America and STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics]? This is us doing STEM in a most exciting way.”

The Penn State lander is called the Lunar Lion, and it can hop rather than merely touch down. After a three to five day cruise and orbit, the Lion would leave Earth’s orbit, discard its solid rocket motor and land directly on the moon.

“The hardest part of the mission is that 2 minutes between when we first fire our rockets and when we touch down,” he said.

That’s an understatement at best -- the hard part is the whole thing, really. Building a moon lander is a wildly complex task for anyone, much less a group of students. To get the project started, Paul worked with engineers at NASA’s Glen Research Center, who nailed down some basic parameters: how big should the thrusters be, how much power is required and so on.

The team then based its work around proven tech where possible, using an existing rocket engine from NASA’s Johnson Space Center, for example.

“We’re building new engines on the model of that engine: reliable, high performance and inexpensive. We’ll be testing those through the spring,” Paul told FoxNews.com.

Students from an array of disciplines, including engineers, business majors and even theater students work in teams on various parts of the project, whether it's propulsion or guidance and controls. The team is 25 percent female, with 10 grad students and 70 undergrad -- 130 total, including faculty and staff.

On Thursdays, while others watch “How I Met Your Mother” or “The Bachelor,” they meets to discuss rocket science.

The students work with professional engineers, as well as corporate partners. Ball Aerospace recently posted a job description to its site for a technical intern to work on the project.

Several graduate students have based their theses around the project, spending months detailing the launch cycle or precisely how the descent phase will work. There are 12 students regularly working in the labs, Paul said.

“Their energy and excitment is unbelievable. I had no idea how much the students would turn this around and own it. They are so proud of being that technically astute person on campus. I had no idea how powerful it would be.”

Help comes in other ways as well: Boeing recently donated 10 solar panels from a communication satellite to the school, a gift worth more than $7 million, Paul said. Some of the solar cells will go directly on the Lunar Lion.

But the team needs money to meet its goals. To that end, the Lunar Lion team on Monday launched a crowd-funding campaign on Rockethub seeking $400,000 more for prototype development.

“The last person on the moon left the moon before I was born,” Paul told FoxNews.com.

He aims to change that equation.

""I want kids to say, 'I want to get into space now. I didn’t know I could be a part of something this exciting and this important.'""

Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said Griffin Campbell was also charged with risking a catastrophe and criminal conspiracy in addition to the six counts of third-degree murder, six counts of involuntary manslaughter and 13 counts of endangerment. In the collapse, an unsupported wall crashed down onto the neighboring thrift store, trapping and killing shoppers inside.

A call to Campbell's cellphone went unanswered but he was expected to surrender to detectives Monday afternoon.

The charges are the first since excavator operator Sean Benschop was charged this summer with six counts of involuntary manslaughter for allegedly operating heavy equipment while high on marijuana and painkillers.

Williams said the collapse remains under investigation but called Campbell the person ""at the center of culpability for the collapse."" He told reporters that Campbell ignored an architect's warning the night before the June 5 collapse to brace the wall.

""The tragic and preventable collapse ... robbed our city of six amazing Philadelphians that perished in the rubble and left an additional 13 wounded,"" Williams said.

Campbell alone chose the demolition method, cutting corners to meet a deadline and cut costs, as he was being paid a flat fee, Williams said.

He was also given the right to salvage floor joints and other material, so he pulled the valuable floor joists out first, destabilizing the exterior walls, Williams said.

A YouTube video taken days before the collapse shows a machine with a claw being used to knock down the facade, and bricks raining down on the open sidewalk. There was also no scaffolding in place to remove an unsupported 40-foot brick wall, which tumbled onto the one-story thrift store, burying the six dead and 13 survivors.

Building owner Richard Basciano was not charged with any crimes Monday, and Williams declined to comment on his fate. However, the grand jury will continue to hear evidence in the case.

Basciano's architect, Plato Marinakos, who had secured the demolition permit, testified before the grand jury after he was promised immunity.

Basciano, once dubbed the pornography king of New York's Times Square, owned the three run-down storefronts being razed.

Several lawsuits have been filed against Basciano, a commercial developer hoping to redevelop the block, along with Campbell, Benschop and others. The victims' lawyers also accuse the city of lax oversight of the demolition process, but the city is generally immune from such lawsuits. One of the victims was the 24-year-old daughter of the city treasurer.","Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams says the contractor overseeing a botched demolition that killed six people shopping in a Salvation Army thrift store is being charged with murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment in the June collapse.",13.3947368421,0.9210526316000001,4.4473684211,low,medium,mixed,architecture

The Height Committee of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat announced its decision Tuesday morning at press conferences in New York City and Chicago.

The committee is recognized as the final arbiter of building heights around the world. It had been weighing whether a design change meant the needle atop 1 World Trade Center is part of the actual building or merely the equivalent of a broadcast antenna.

The committee announced Tuesday that the needle was a spire, and therefore, a part of the actual building. Twenty-five members of the group met in Chicago on Nov. 8 to debate the height of the building.

“To us it’s not very fuzzy it all,” said Timothy Johnson, chairman of the council.

Johnson said as the members came out of a room after they agreed that 1 World Trade Center is America’s tallest building, they realized they “had [made] a little part of history in this decision.”

The tower built on the site of the 9/11 attacks is a symbolically important 1,776 feet tall with the 408-foot needle. It would be 1,368 feet tall without it, shorter than the 1,450-foot Willis Tower in Chicago.

One World Trade Center’s 1,368 feet height without the needle also holds symbolism; it is the height of the original World Trade Center.

The designers originally had intended to enclose the mast's communications gear in decorative cladding made of fiberglass and steel.

But the developer removed that exterior shell from the design, saying it would be impossible to properly maintain or repair. Without it, the question was whether the mast was now primarily just a broadcast antenna.

Under the council's current criteria, spires that are an integral part of a building's aesthetic design count. Broadcast antennas that can be added and removed do not.

The new World Trade Center tower remains under construction and is expected to open next year.

“The challenge is now back with Chicago—can you build another bigger building?” Johnson asked.

The new World Trade Center is now the fourth tallest building worldwide, behind Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, at 2,717 feet tall, Shanghai’s Shanghai Tower, at 2,074 feet tall, and the Makkah Royal Clock Tower in Mecca, which stands at 1,972 feet, according to Emporis.

The Modular Airborne Firefighting Systems-equipped planes, or MAFFS, will lift off from nearby Peterson Air Force base after a request from the U.S. Forest Service late Tuesday night.

These are aerial firefighting system that can discharge 3,000 gallons of water or fire retardant in less than five seconds, covering an area one-quarter of a mile long by 100 feet wide.

There are four reported fires: El Paso County, Royal Gorge, Rocky Mountain National Park and Huerfano County.

The burning south of the Royal Gorge Bridge and it destroyed three structures near Canon City.

The Black Forest Fire in a heavily wooded residential area northeast of Colorado Springs burned 40 to 60 homes after it broke out Tuesday and prompted evacuations of about 2,300 homes, affecting about 6,400 people, El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa said late Tuesday.

At the Black Forest Fire, six helicopters and an air tanker were on the scene, Maketa said. The office of Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., said C-130 cargo planes were expected to be prepared to help fight the fire Wednesday.

The area is not far from last summer's devastating Waldo Canyon Fire that destroyed 346 homes and killed two.

""It's very, very reminiscent of what we experienced in Waldo Canyon,"" Maketa said.

However, there were no immediate reports of injuries in the fires.

All of the fires moved quickly Tuesday, driven by record temperatures and strong winds. The conditions were making it difficult to build containment lines around the fires, and sparks jumped across them.

""Weather is not working with us right now, but our guys are giving it a heck of a shot,"" Maketa said.

In southern Colorado, the Bureau of Land Management said three structures have been lost in a fire on about 6 square miles near the Royal Gorge Bridge. Authorities evacuated Royal Gorge Bridge & Park, home of the soaring suspension bridge spanning the canyon across the Arkansas River.

A third wildfire in southern Colorado erupted Tuesday in rural Huerfano County. The Klikus Fire had burned an estimated 45 to 50 acres west of La Veta, prompting evacuation orders for about 200 residences.

The causes of those fires weren't immediately confirmed.

A fourth wildfire sparked by lightning Monday in Rocky Mountain National Park quickly grew to an estimated 300 to 400 acres Tuesday. No structures were threatened.

In the Colorado Springs area, George Gonzales, 74, and his wife stayed in their motorhome in the parking lot of a Red Cross shelter set up for evacuees from the Black Forest Fire. He said the two were eating lunch in town when his daughter got an alert on her phone about the fire and called them.

An officer let them go home to retrieve their dogs, their motorhome and truck, and his heart medicine, George Gonzales said.

""Sure, we're worried, but we're hoping for the best,"" he said.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has authorized federal funds to defray costs of fighting the Black Forest and Royal Gorge fires.

""There is nobody backing away and saying we're not going to attack this with everything that we've got,"" Gov. John Hickenlooper said late Tuesday.

The wildfire forced the evacuation of more than 900 prisoners at a state prison southwest of Colorado Springs early Wednesday, one of four blazes across the Front Range that destroyed dozens of homes and forced thousands of people to flee.

Department of Corrections spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson said prisoners from the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility were taken to other prisons around the Front Range overnight. The evacuation was ordered because of the danger from heavy smoke, she said. The fire has not reached the prison.

""This was done as a precaution because it takes a lot of time to move the prisoners,"" Jacobson said.

The medium- and low-risk prisoners were evacuated by bus, including 24 from an infirmary who were taken to a Denver facility to protect them from smoke, some in wheelchairs.

Chris Christie to lament that the Garden State’s best feature would “never be the same.”

The men and women who earn their living at the beach and on the boardwalk don't dispute the governor's words. But with summer fast approaching, they are making a final push to salvage what they can of the upcoming tourist season. And while some of the boardwalk that inspired Bruce Springsteen is still under construction, locals know the features that matter most are the sun and the surf. They'll do what they can about the rest.

2.7 million: Number of power outages in New Jersey after Superstorm Sandy 2.5 million: Cubic yards of sand and silt deposited on road and waterways from Sandy 37,000: Amount of primary residences deemed by FEMA to have incurred ""major damage"" 1.1 billion: Total federal allocations for Superstorm Sandy response and recovery in New Jersey 3.3 billion: Total National Flood Insurance Program payments made to policy holders in New York 89,025: Number of New Jersey residents who have visited FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers 6,088: Average amount of money awarded by FEMA per applicant for housing assistance 480: Amount of volunteer agencies active in disaster recovery effort 195,000: Number of room nights in 435 hotels and motels paid for by FEMA while displaced survivors sought permanent housing solutions 7.6 million: Cost of the reconstruction of the Seaside Heights boardwalk, which is slated to reopen to the public on Memorial Day

“We’re open. Come on down,” said Vinny Scuzzese, who has set up two game tents in the lot behind his boardwalk food stand and arcade in Seaside Heights. “This business is my only income. I had to do something while we wait for the boardwalk to be finished. We brought the games to the street.”

Scuzzese says that the stretch of boardwalk where his shop lies will be ready by the start of the season and with it, he will be open for business come Memorial Day.

After the storm barreled into and up the shore in late October, images of the Jet Star, twisted and jutting out of the water, illustrated Sandy's devastation to generations of revelers who had sought thrills on the iconic roller coaster. Its owner, Casino Pier, also has a lot of repair work to be done and will likely not be finished by the end of May. Still, officials say rides will be up and running by the end of the month.

“The top pier where we had rides like the roller-coaster and the log flume has been the longest to rebuild,” said Maria Mastoris, spokeswoman for Casino Pier. “At least half the rides will be up by Memorial Day and then we will have to see how it goes throughout the season.”

“We’ve had great progress since six months ago. The pier is being rebuilt as we speak and will soon be walkable. We’re very optimistic about our opening.”

Not so fortunate is Funtown Pier, at the southern end of the boardwalk in Seaside Park. Its proprietors have given up hope for this season, but vow to be back in 2014.

According to a report by the Asbury Park Press, many of the towns along the shore are on track to welcome tourists this summer, even if they aren't what they were before Sandy:

A recent poll by the Asbury Park Press found 73 percent of the state’s residents are satisfied with recovery efforts. Christie was upbeat on the recovery process on Monday in an interview with MSNBC, proclaiming that President Obama “has kept every promise he’s made,” regarding help for the Garden State.","Six months after superstorm Sandy, the ravaged Jersey Shore appears to be on track as a final push for rebuilding is being made less than a month before the start of what has become a crucial summer tourist season.",17.7317073171,0.8292682927,1.6585365854,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

The Palestinians strongly condemned the announcement and repeated their refusal to start peace negotiations while building continued. With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apparently poised for re-election and insisting that any negotiations begin without preconditions, prospects for peace appear to be going into deep freeze.

The unusually large building plan came a day after the United Nations voted overwhelmingly to accept a Palestinian state in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem as a non-member observer state, setting off jubilant celebrations among Palestinians.

Israel fiercely objected to the U.N. upgrade, saying peace could only come from direct negotiations and unilateral moves would harm that prospect. The Palestinians said the U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state in the territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war was an attempt to salvage a possible peace deal and could bolster talks.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has refused to negotiate with Israeli while settlement construction continues in occupied territories, saying Israel's settlement expansion on war-won land was making a partition deal increasingly difficult.

Prior to word of the Israeli decision, Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdeneh insisted that position hadn't changed, saying settlement building ""is not just illegal, it's against the resolution.""

More than 500,000 Israelis have moved to the West Bank and east Jerusalem since Israel capturing those territories and Gaza in 1967. Israel unilaterally withdrew its soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005.

Netanyahu says negotiations must begin without preconditions.

The Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the sensitive issue publicly, said Israel also decided to begin preliminary work in other areas of the West Bank, including the charged E-1 corridor that connects Jerusalem with the settlement bloc of Maaleh Adumim.

Construction there would place a major obstacle for Palestinian statehood by cutting off east Jerusalem from the West Bank and plans there had previously blocked by the Bush administration for that reason.

Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned the Israeli announcement, saying Israel was ""defying the whole international community and insisting on destroying the two-state solution.""

He said the Palestinian leadership was studying its options.

Danny Seidemann, a lawyer for Ir Amim, an Israeli group that supports coexistence in Jerusalem, said construction did not appear imminent and there was ""quite a lot of drama"" in the Israeli announcement.

""There an element of sticking it to the Palestinians,"" he said, before adding that plans in E-1 were not only a blow to the Palestinians but to the Americans who oppose them too. ""E-1 is the judgment day weapons.""

Yesh Din, an Israeli rights group, called the Israeli decision ""collective punishment"" and called on Israel to retract its move.

""Israel should have understood by now that such behavior ... will no longer be tolerated by the international community,"" said Yesh Din's Executive Director Haim Erlich.

Earlier this month, Israel said it was pushing forward construction of 1,200 new homes in Jewish settlements, in an apparent warning to the Palestinians to rethink their U.N. plan. Israel fears the Palestinians will use their upgraded status to confront Israel in international bodies and extort it to make concessions.

In recent days, though, Israel had appeared to step back from its initial threats of harsh retaliation.

Former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, the onetime chief negotiator with the Palestinians, also slammed the decision.

""The decision at the U.N. on a Palestinian state is bad for Israel and so is Netanyahu's response,"" said Livni, who this week launched a new opposition party. ""The decision to build thousands of housing units as punishment to the Palestinians only punishes Israel ... the unnecessary statement only isolates Israel further.""

The results of the U.N. vote were a foregone conclusion, given the sympathies of nearly all member states. Only nine states opposed the bid, including Israel and the United States, while 138 supported it. Unlike the more powerful U.N. Security Council, there are no vetoes in the General Assembly, and the resolution to raise the Palestinian status only required a majority vote for approval.

The vote granted Abbas an overwhelming international endorsement for his key position: establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Netanyahu opposes a full pullback to the 1967 lines.

The Palestinians turned to the U.N. after two decades of on-again, off-again talks.

Netanyahu dismissed the U.N. vote as meaningless and accused Abbas of delivering a ""defamatory and venomous"" U.N. speech ""full of mendacious propaganda"" against Israel.","Israeli official says government okays settlement construction of 3,000 new West Bank units.",65.2857142857,0.9285714286000001,1.5,high,medium,abstractive,architecture

Akin rebuilding Senate bid in Missouri,1970-01-01 00:33:32.092319,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – Written off by many in his own party a mere month ago, Republican Rep. Todd Akin has been slowly rebuilding his Senate campaign after apologizing for inflammatory remarks about pregnancy and rape.

Now Akin is approaching a critical week that could determine whether his re-emerging campaign can gain enough momentum to put Missouri back in the battleground column as Republicans attempt to win control of the Senate from Democrats.

Tuesday is the deadline for Akin to get a court order to drop his challenge of Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. But Akin says he won't do so. Instead, Akin plans to ramp up his campaign. He's holding a fundraiser Monday with former Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. He's addressing a potentially influential group of pastors Tuesday morning. Then as the drop-out clock ticks down, he's kicking off a statewide bus tour for his Senate bid that will include venerable conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly.

""I believe the state of the campaign is looking better and better,"" Akin said Friday after engaging McCaskill in their first debate and then rallying on the Missouri Capitol lawn with supporters of a newly formed women-for-Akin coalition.

Akin has apologized repeatedly since a TV interview aired Aug. 19 in which he suggested that women's bodies have a natural defense against pregnancy in cases of ""legitimate rape."" He has repeatedly rejected calls of top national Republicans -- including presidential candidate Mitt Romney -- to quit the race so the state GOP committee can appoint a replacement candidate. Yet some have doubted Akin's resolve.

""There are a lot of donors who have sat on the sidelines and are waiting"" for Tuesday's drop-out deadline to pass, said Rick Tyler, a former Gingrich aide who joined Akin's campaign as part of the re-building effort. ""We are tilling that hard soil now -- that is, reaching out to people who could potentially give significant amounts of dollars.""

Come Tuesday, ""those donors are going to see that Todd's going to be on the ballot,"" Tyler adds.

Whether that triggers an avalanche of money for Akin remains one of the most important questions facing his campaign.

Akin already was starting from behind against McCaskill financially after spending all but a few hundred thousand dollars to win a contentious Aug. 7 Republican primary. After his rape remark, Akin lost the financial support of the Republican National Committee, the Republican senators' political committee and the deep-pocketed Crossroads group affiliated with Republican strategist Karl Rove. That zapped millions of dollars of planned TV advertising.

Since then, Akin has raised nearly $600,000 through a small-dollar, online appeal that has cast his candidacy as an anti-establishment crusade against both Republican Party bosses and President Barack Obama's administration. Former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has aided the Internet fundraising drive. But Gingrich's event Monday -- at $500 a person or $750 per couple -- will be Akin's first prominent headliner for a traditional fundraiser in at least five weeks.

""This is an act of conscience on my part -- I didn't like seeking a guy getting beaten up by the power structure,"" Gingrich said.

But Gingrich also is pragmatic.

""If the Republicans are going to win control of the Senate, they need Missouri,"" said Gingrich, who led the Republican takeover of the U.S. House in 1994.

Others also are considering coming to Akin's aid, including Sen. Jim DeMint, of South Carolina, who has built the Senate Conservatives Fund into a formidable fundraising organization for its favored candidates.

Republicans need a net gain of four seats in the November elections to take control of the Senate. But Republican-held seats in Maine and Massachusetts are jeopardy, and losses there would increase the number of seats the GOP must wrest away from Democrats. Missouri had been considered one of the Republicans' best chances for a pick-up until Akin's rape remark undercut his campaign.

Regardless, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus flatly reiterated on Sunday he would be sending no resources to aid Akin's campaign.

""We're not going to play in Missouri with Todd Akin, I can tell you that. So it'll be yet to be seen whether he stays in or not,"" Priebus told ABC's ""This Week.""

Republican consultant John Hancock, who worked for one of Akin's opponents in the primary, said outside groups had been expected to spend about $15 million to support a Republican Senate candidate in Missouri. Even then, a Republican candidate likely needed to chip in $6 million or $7 million from his own campaign to offset the money from McCaskill and Democratic-aligned groups, Hancock said.

Under that model, a typical candidate would need to be holding about two, $500-a-plate fundraisers a week and as many as five, $2,500-a-plate fundraisers a month, including some out of state, Hancock said.

Gingrich's fundraiser is just one of many that Akin will need in the coming weeks. But if he remains close in the polls to McCaskill, those dollars could start coming a little easier.

""If you get to the first week or second week of October and the Missouri race is still unquestionably part of the equation for getting to 51 senators, then I would be shocked if outside money didn't come in,"" Hancock said, of the Republican strategy to win control of the Senate.

Akin doesn't expect to recoup all of the financial support he lost. That's why his campaign is focusing heavily on organizing grass-roots coalitions. Akin likely can expect a strong effort from his traditional base of anti-abortion activists and Christian conservatives, but he also needs the support of gun enthusiasts and business owners, some of whom backed Akin's rivals in the Republican primary, Tyler said.

This past week, the inaugural event by a new group of female Akin supporters drew about 300 people in the St. Louis area. A few days later, around 100 turned out for a similar event in Jefferson City, though they were countered by protesters who chanted ""rape is rape"" while Akin spoke to the crowd.

Julie Thomas, a mother of three from the Lake of Ozarks, said she took it upon herself to organize the women-for-Akin rally. She described herself as strongly ""pro-life"" and praised Akin as ""a man with unparalleled character.""

""Whenever he got thrown under the bus by his own party, I just said, `uh, uh.' That was a tipping point for me,"" Thomas said.

Even as top Republicans abandoned Akin after his remarks, McCaskill insisted that she still expected a close Senate race. At their first debate Friday, McCaskill took on the role of a challenger -- striking first and furiously with accusations that Akin's positions are too extreme on contraception, Medicare, student loans and other issues.

""Our campaign is working hard and taking nothing for granted,"" said McCaskill spokeswoman Caitlin Legacki. ""You can expect Claire to continue working as if she's running from behind.""","Written off by many in his own party a mere month ago, Republican Rep.",92.0666666667,1.0,15.0,high,high,extractive,architecture

According to insiders, Ed Helms and John Krasinski are moving closer to signing new deals for next season. ""Everyone's coming into the final yard line,"" says a show insider.

Next year would likely be the last season for both actors, as their film careers take off. A source close to Helms says the actor would like to return, at least for part of the year, and that he has submitted a counterproposal to the studio's initial offer.

But before Helms' and Krasinski's pacts are finalized, the show will have to figure out how to accommodate their busy movie schedules. Helms is expected take a break to shoot ""The Hangover 3"" (a greenlight is likely), while Krasinski may have to miss some episodes to star opposite Matt Damon in ""Promised Land."" Ideally, they wouldn't be gone at the same time.

""The Office"" remains NBC's top-rated comedy and is a shoo-in for renewal once deals with the show's key actors are done. Next season would mark the ninth for ""The Office"" — but could it be the show's last?

""It's likely to be written for some of the characters as a last year,"" says one insider. ""But if a couple new characters are introduced or other story ideas emerge, you just never know."" Adds another source: ""They've had those discussions about what would happen if it were to be the last year.""

NBC might be loath to give up its signature sitcom, but with so much big change afoot, producers may see next year as a natural ending point. Mindy Kaling's pilot at Fox is said to be an early favorite as a potential companion to ""New Girl""; even if Fox doesn't pick up the comedy, her NBC deal is expiring and it's unclear if she would return. James Spader, who joined just this season, is also departing.

Then there's the potential spinoff featuring Rainn Wilson's Dwight Schrute, which NBC hasn't formally announced but is quietly confirming. An episode early next season is expected to double as a backdoor pilot for the Dwight-centric show, set at Schrute Farms. Such a project could keep ""The Office"" legacy alive in the same way that ""Frasier"" served as a post-series extension of ""Cheers.""

Executive producer Paul Lieberstein, who plays Toby, is planning to focus his energy on the Dwight project, which is partly why Universal TV is looking for a new showrunner for ""The Office."" Universal and executive producer Greg Daniels have met with potential candidates to take on oversight of the writers' room, but one of the leading contenders is a familiar face: B.J. Novak, who plays Ryan and is already an executive producer.

Whoever takes the reins faces several challenges including potentially having to craft proper send-offs for Jim, Andy and Dwight. The overall direction of the show may be in for an overhaul, as critics have been mixed on the show's first post-Steve Carell season.

Even though I'm a plant lover, (so many plants, so little time) it's the structures in this garden that make it work for me. The design of the garden and attention to detail both with the ornaments and the plants is such that the garden charms during every season. While this landscape is on a grand scale compared to most home gardens, the effective use of structures including arbors, walls, gazebos and trellises, offers ideas that can be adapted to suit gardens whether large and small.

When deciding what type of garden structures to add to your own garden, start with where you are. By this I mean: What type of house do you have? What is the climate? Where do you live? The answers to these questions should be your guide when selecting the design, materials and scale of any structures you add to your landscape or garden.

Is your house formal or informal? The design should relate in some way to the type of house you have, and if possible, should tie the house and garden together. For instance:

In my own garden, I put in a low (knee high) retaining wall to help define my garden. The material I chose was granite, the same stone that our house is made of. Although it was not inexpensive, now that it is complete there is no maintenance required and I should not have to spend any additional money except on plants. I also recommend that you determine what style suits your garden and stick to it. The structures you use should relate to other structures, whether existing or new.

Scale is tricky too, I have visited gardens where the arbor is so small, and the materials are flimsy, resulting in something that looks as if it has been plunked down. When you think about scale, remember the sky is your ceiling. An arbor that is big enough for two people to walk through comfortably, side by side, with plenty of room, as well as overhead space will make a stronger statement than an arbor that is only big enough for one person to barely squeeze through.

I should mention that there may be situations where you have a large area and you want to direct views to a focal point such as a sculpture. In this case a narrow path surrounded by plants works well.

Don't forget to consider how the structures you use will look in the winter when the garden is quiet. Most of all, whatever structures you choose, like your garden, should please you.

The meeting, held at the resort of Punta Cana, is the first for the reconstruction committee led by former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive. Together they will oversee an estimated $5.3 billion in reconstruction projects through next year.

Some 90 international delegations met to discuss the priorities to be given to 40 projects including housing, free-trade zones, electricity, education, government strengthening and agriculture.

""The longer that the victims continue living in precarious conditions, the more they will have reason to be discontent. That discontent can be manipulated for political ends,"" U.N. envoy Edmond Mulet said.

Clinton, who toured the hard-hit Haitian city of Leogane on Tuesday, stressed the urgent need to provide shelter during hurricane season, which began this week.

""We can not let people die for lack of safe shelters,"" Clinton said, lamenting that shortages persist despite pledges of international aid.

Earthquake camps in the Haitian capital are swelling instead of shrinking, with an estimated 1.5 million people now living under tarps, tents and a few transitional shelters. Many can no longer pay rent, or have left standing homes in search of aid begin delivered to the homeless.

Officials also discussed ways to finance a planned Nov. 28 election to replace President Rene Preval, whose term expires next year. Jose Miguel Insulza, secretary general of the Organization of American States, pledged help creating the electoral roll and modernizing computer systems for the vote.

Preval set off protests when he published a law extending his term by up to three months if the election is not held on time. On Wednesday, he reiterated a pledge to step down as scheduled on Feb. 7.

Other proposals discussed included a $14 million wind farm on the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic that would provide 20 megawatts of energy.

The reconstruction committee is scheduled to hold its first working meeting later this month. It includes Haitian legislators, local officials, union and business representatives and a delegate from the Caribbean Community trade bloc.

The panel also has a representative from each donor who has pledged Haiti at least $100 million over two years or $200 million of debt reduction. Among them are the United States, Canada, Brazil, France, Venezuela, the European Union, Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank and United Nations.

On Tuesday evening, police carted 593 towering plants from the otherwise unremarkable brick building, as well as 75 pounds of marijuana cut, dried and packaged in plastic, ready for distribution. Authorities said that by a ""conservative estimate,"" the operation did at least $3 million in business last year. Three men were arrested in connection with the case.

It certainly wasn't the biggest marijuana bust in New York City, not by a long shot. In 2009, 50,000 pounds of marijuana was found stuffed in a home in Queens, and there have been plenty of other bigger busts in the region.

What made Tuesday's discovery unusual was the location of the farm: a busy urban area on a block lined with similar five-story walk-up buildings occupying people, not leafy trees thriving under a sophisticated air filtration, irrigation and lighting system with fans and sprinklers to ensure healthy crops.

Police said they began investigating the building two months ago after at least one complaint from an area resident about shady activities there. But it was not clear if most neighbors knew what was going on inside the structure. Most of those who spoke with local media as they watched police carting out sacks of pot plants said they were stunned.

""It's terrible. Too close to home,"" one woman told the local ABC TV affiliate, WABC. ""I've walked through here for maybe three or four years and I never, ever would have thought that they would have a pot factory in this building,"" a man said.

Others, however, told reporters that the odor wafting from the urban farm was noticeable and sometimes got innocent people into trouble. ""Cops come on the block and smell weed and pull us over and harass us, and no one is smoking,"" Andre Cardona told the Daily News.

Architect Bill Greaves stood on a bluff outside the city and admired an elegant white and peach building perched high above the beaches and guesthouses that have made this seaside spot into a tourist boomtown. Inspired by the

, a pole used by rural Cambodians to carry loads on their shoulders, the building seemed to float in the air, its concrete and brick second floor held aloft by a complex web of hidden beams.

""It's a gem, but it's not very well known,"" Greaves said of the SKD Brewery offices, built in 1968 by

most gifted and visionary architect, Vann Molyvann.

In the 1960s, under the iron-fisted patronage of Prince

, Vann Molyvann helped transform

from a sleepy former French colony into one of the most architecturally arresting countries in Asia. But after surviving decades of civil war and the terror of Khmer Rouge rule, the architect's buildings are being demolished as Cambodia seeks to rebuild.

Although Vann Molyvann, 83, is back in Phnom Penh after years of living overseas, there is little he can do to prevent his work from disappearing. In 2008, two of his greatest works, the National Theater and the Council of Ministers building, were demolished. In 2001, the government sold his Olympic Stadium to a Taiwanese developer, who altered the complex's drainage system to the point that it floods frequently.

In response, admirers such as Greaves, art historian Darryl Collins, who cowrote the only book in English about 1950s and 1960s Cambodian architecture, and architect Geoff Pyle, who founded an organization that offers guided tours of Phnom Penh's notable buildings, are working to highlight Vann Molyvann's importance. He remains virtually unknown in Cambodia, where he is not taught in the country's high schools and universities, and his international profile is low.

Greaves had traveled from his base in Phnom Penh to the brewery in Sihanoukville with a team of volunteers working with the Vann Molyvann Project, an organization he established in 2009 to document the architect's buildings. Nearly all of Vann Molyvann's blueprints were lost during Cambodia's years of turmoil, so Greaves and his volunteers are re-creating them from scratch to leave a record for future generations.

As the sun burned off the morning mist and lipstick-red trucks roared by full of Angkor beer — the SKD complex remains a functioning brewery — Cambodian and American volunteers in their 20s moved methodically through the space, hand measuring doorways, columns and anything else they could get their tape measurers on. They would spend the better part of three days sizing up the building before heading back to Phnom Penh, where they were creating scale models and drawings for the first major exhibition of Vann Molyvann's work, which opened in Phnom Penh in late September.

Greaves first encountered Vann Molyvann's buildings when he was visiting as a tourist in 2004. ""I was astonished. I didn't know anything about architecture in Cambodia in the 1960s,"" he said. He was struck by the architect's daring use of concrete to create massive, expressive forms, ""the kinds of things you could never convince a structural engineer to do nowadays,"" he said.

The buildings ingeniously used what might now be called green technology, including ventilation, natural lighting and drainage systems, to mitigate Cambodia's harsh climate, which alternates between periods of torrential rain and extreme heat. The buildings also referenced objects from Cambodian culture, such as mystical Buddhist serpents called

and the straw hats worn by peasants working in the fields.

After returning to Cambodia several times, Greaves quit his job at Steven Harris Architects in New York and moved to Phnom Penh to found the Vann Molyvann Project, which has consulted extensively with the Cambodian architect in its work. ""I am extremely grateful for what they are doing,"" Vann Molyvann said of his foreign admirers.

Vann Molyvann's life has been shaped by the twists and turns of his country's tumultuous history. Born in 1926, he attended Cambodia's only high school during

. However, his studies were interrupted by

takeover of the country during the war, but he managed to graduate and in 1945 won one of two scholarships that year for Cambodians to study in

At the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he received architectural training from disciples of Le Corbusier, who taught him the influential French architect's

a system of proportion that Vann Molyvann later used as the basis for his designs. He thought little about his home country and ""drowned in French culture completely,"" he said. Meanwhile, his compatriots in Paris at the time, including a young

, soaked up the Marxism and Stalinism that would form the ideological basis of the Khmer Rouge.

Vann Molyvann returned to Phnom Penh in 1956, and he was one of a few architects in Cambodia with formal training. Cambodia had gained independence from France in 1953, but it remained a poor, rural country with no recent history of cities or urban planning. ""Architecture was a strange concept in Cambodia. They did not know what it was,"" he said. He opened a firm but found little private work.

His fortunes changed when Norodom Sihanouk appointed him chief architect for state buildings and director for urban planning and habitat. With access to government commissions, he could begin designing civic buildings that combined the Modernist and Brutalist sensibilities he had learned in Paris with Cambodia's traditions and way of life.

Over the next decade and a half, Vann Molyvann built dozens of buildings in Phnom Penh and elsewhere in Cambodia. His crowning achievement was the Olympic Stadium, a sprawling sports complex that was built in advance of the Southeast Asian Games of 1963, which were never held. With a water-management system inspired by the moats and channels of ancient Angkor and soaring concrete overhangs, the design helped usher in a period of architectural and cultural creativity. He was in his early 30s at the time. ""Imagine having the possibility to build such a thing when you are that age,"" Vann Molyvann said, his eyes twinkling.

Norodom Sihanouk viewed architecture as a way of expressing the aspirations for progress and modernity of the newly independent Cambodian people. He poured significant portions of the national budget into construction projects, and he deftly exploited Cambodia's Cold War neutrality to land aid from both the Americans and the Soviets.

""Sihanouk was extremely open to the outside world,"" Vann Molyvann said. ""Cambodians had enormous enthusiasm to build the country, and fortunately for us, Prince Sihanouk shared this feeling.""

Norodom Sihanouk's showpiece was the Russian Boulevard, which connected central Phnom Penh to its international airport. Lined with many of Vann Molyvann's most significant buildings, including the Teachers' Training College and the Council of Ministers building, the road was designed to impress visiting dignitaries.

But Norodom Sihanouk could not keep his country neutral forever. With the

spilling over into Cambodia, Vann Molyvann left with his family in 1972, and the prince's cosmopolitanism eventually gave way to the savage xenophobia of the Khmer Rouge. Vann Molyvann spent the next two decades as a consultant with the

at various posts around the world.

He moved back to Cambodia in 1993, but his second return has proved more difficult than the first. Although he was appointed head of the organization that managed the site of the Angkor temples, the current government of Prime Minister

removed him from that post after he publicly complained about government corruption. ""I felt that entrance fees for Angkor should go to the people, not to civil servants in Phnom Penh. They said, 'Get out, Molyvann,'"" he said.

Out of favor with the government, Vann Molyvann has watched the urban landscape in Phnom Penh transform. Norodom Sihanouk's Russian Boulevard, that bellwether of Cambodia's aspirations, now swarms with trucks and motorbikes carrying goods and migrants into the city, and it is lined with the glass-and-steel office buildings and cookie-cutter housing developments of Cambodia's recent economic boom. The new Chinese-designed and funded Council of Ministers building, which replaced Vann Molyvann's, features a pyramid framed by what resembles an enormous drawbridge. It would not look out of place in a Chinese provincial capital.

""There's a very strong notion in Cambodia that a modern city should be like Shanghai or Bangkok, where the emphasis is on verticality,"" said Greaves of the Vann Molyvann Project. ""Late Modern architecture is a little harder for the general public to love.""

While the efforts of Greaves and others have raised Vann Molyvann's profile among Cambodians, the fate of his buildings ultimately rests with the current government, which came to power in 1979 after defeating the Khmer Rouge. ""The government doesn't want to leave anything from before 1979, because it wasn't their achievement. History is completely manipulated,"" Vann Molyvann said.

Today, he has an official government title, but it is essentially an honorific. He is working on translating his PhD dissertation, about urbanization in Southeast Asia, into Khmer, the Cambodian language.

Beng Khemro, deputy director general of the country's Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction, said the government is doing everything it can to preserve Cambodia's architectural heritage. ""But economic development and modernization inevitably bring about changes in every country, and Cambodia is no exception,"" he said.

Young Cambodians like Yin Sotheara, a 21-year-old architecture student and volunteer with the Vann Molyvann Project, hope to play a role in that development. Back at the SKD Brewery offices, he took a break from measuring a rear-facing balcony to discuss his future after graduation.

""There are not many opportunities for Cambodian architects. Most of the new buildings are being built by Chinese and Koreans,"" he said. But learning about Vann Molyvann had for the first time provided him with a Cambodian architectural role model. ""Vann Molyvann showed that you can take foreign concepts and mix them with Cambodian traditions to make new buildings,"" he said. ""I want to make buildings that are suited to the Cambodian way of life.""","Architect Bill Greaves stood on a bluff outside the city  and admired an elegant white and peach building perched high above the beaches and guesthouses that have made this seaside spot into a tourist boomtown. Inspired by the  dong raik , a pole used by rural Cambodians to carry loads on their shoulders, the building seemed to float in the air, its concrete and brick second floor held aloft by a complex web of hidden beams.",23.9146341463,0.9512195122,30.0243902439,medium,high,extractive,architecture

Constructed more than a decade ago, the Mukhabarat building on the northwest edge of Gaza City was once home to the Palestinian Authority's super-secret intelligence service. It was abandoned in 2007 after the Hamas militant group seized the Gaza Strip and chased out the rival Fatah party.

Vacant ever since, the once-grand structure has become something of a running joke: Israel keeps striking it over and over, yet a good-sized chunk of the five-story frame simply won't fall down.

In virtually every conflict or flare-up between Israel and Hamas over the last five years, including the current one, the complex takes a few rockets or missiles. Twenty? Fifty? Neighbors say they've lost count.

""It's amazing that anything's left,"" said Um Mohamed Khalaf, 42, who lives nest door with her eight children.

The building, dubbed ""The Ship"" for its massive size and stout shape, is a shell of its former self, and looks as if it won't last much longer. There are just a couple of precariously leaning stories left and a curiously intact staircase.

For many Gazans, the complex's refusal to collapse has come to symbolize Palestinian survival and defiance.

No one knows why Israel keeps striking the empty building, though Khalaf said militants use the area to launch rockets. Others say it's to intimidate the nearby residents.

Whatever the reason, people have learned to run whenever tension with Israel rises, expecting the besieged concrete building to receive a few more licks.

""I didn't wait around this time and decided to move once the fighting began,"" said cellphone vendor Ibrahim Omar, 25, who moved his pregnant wife to another part of the city. ""It's too dangerous to stay.""

Each time an Israeli airstrike hits, windows break and shrapnel flies into neighboring structures, including the high school next door. Many people stopped replacing windows because they just get broken again. One neighbor was wounded during an attack years ago.

""Once a piece of shrapnel landed in the kitchen and destroyed the refrigerator,"" Khalaf said. ""The kids are so terrified they wet the bed at night. We'd move, but we have no place go.""

At first, neighbors welcomed the building, which not only brought prestige to the area but also better security and reliable electricity. It was a source of pride, even though none of the residents were ever permitted to enter the tightly guarded facility.

After Fatah fled, locals rushed in for the first time, helping themselves to expensive furniture, computer equipment, window frames and anything else they could salvage.

But now the building is such an eyesore and target that the neighborhood wrote a letter to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, asking that it be torn down and replaced with a hospital or sports stadium.

A few months ago, demolition crews got to work, destroying even more of the building. But the tear-down was interrupted when the conflict with Israel flared.

In recent days, Israeli strikes have hit around the perimeter of the building. No one's sure whether it will survive another round of damage, said Abu Mohamed, who lives across the road and did not want to give his full name.

Even though he's been fighting to have the building demolished, he acknowledged that he uses a photo of it taken during its better days as his computer's screen saver.

Glancing over, he added with an air of nostalgia, ""I'm going to miss it, actually.""",GAZA CITY  &mdash; It's the building that refuses to die.,47.2666666667,0.7333333333000001,5.6666666667,high,low,mixed,architecture

were struck by bullets fired by the two officers, police said Saturday, citing ballistics evidence.

The veteran patrolmen who opened fire on the suit-wearing gunman, Jeffrey Johnson, had only an instant to react when he whirled and pointed a .45-caliber pistol as they approached him from behind on a busy sidewalk.

Officer Craig Matthews shot seven times. Officer Robert Sinishtaj fired nine times, police said. Neither had ever fired their weapons before on a patrol.

The volley of gunfire felled Johnson in just a few seconds and left nine other people bleeding on the sidewalk.

In the initial chaos Friday, it wasn't clear whether Johnson or the officers were responsible for the trail of wounded, but based on ballistic and other evidence, ""it appears that all nine of the victims were struck either by fragments or by bullets fired by police,"" Police Commissioner

told reporters on Saturday at a community event in Harlem.

He reiterated that the officers appeared to have no choice but to shoot Johnson, whose body had 10 bullets wounds in the chest, arms and legs.

""I believe it was handled well,"" Kelly said.

The officers confronted Johnson as he walked, casually, down the street after gunning down a former co-worker on the sidewalk outside the office they once shared. The shooting happened at 9 a.m., as the neighborhood bustled with people arriving for work.

The gunman and his victim, Steve Ercolino, had a history of workplace squabbles before Johnson was laid off from their company, Hazan Import Corp., a year ago. At one point, the two men had grappled physically in an elevator.

John Koch, the property manager at the office building where the men worked, said security camera footage showed the two pushing and shoving. The tussle ended when Ercolino, a much larger man, pinned Johnson against the wall of the elevator by the throat, Koch said. Ercolino let him go after a few moments, and the two men went their separate ways.

""They didn't like each other,"" Koch said.

After shooting Ercolino, Johnson, an eccentric T-shirt designer and avid bird-watcher who wore a suit every day, even when photographing hawks in

, walked away as if nothing had happened.

Alerted by a construction worker, officers Matthews and Sinishtaj gave chase as Johnson rounded a corner and walked along Fifth Avenue, in front of the landmark skyscraper.

A security videotape from the scene shows several civilians — including three sitting on a bench only a few feet away — scattering as the officers opened fire.

Police have determined that three people were struck by whole bullets — two of which were removed from victims at the hospital — and the rest were grazed ""by fragments of some sort,"" Kelly said.

Three people remained hospitalized, all in stable condition, police said.

Both Matthews, 39, and Sinishtaj, 40, joined the nation's largest police department 15 years ago.

Matthews had drawn attention earlier this year by filing a lawsuit against the New York Police Department that accused his superiors of unfairly punishing him for not meeting arrest quotas. A judge threw out the complaint.

There was no immediate response to a message left with the union representing the two officers.

The shooting didn't deter tourists from flocking to the Empire State Building as usual on Saturday.

Patricia Flynn, 57, a retired schoolteacher, visited the building's peak with her elderly mother, who once worked in the skyscraper as a secretary.

""But I didn't tell her what happened,"" said Flynn, adding that her mother was unaware of Friday's shooting. ""And she really enjoyed the view.""

A group of 31 tourists from all over France held a meeting Friday night at their nearby hotel to decide whether to cancel their planned Empire State Building visit.

""We were scared, and we thought it was a risk,"" said Catherine Krukar, 38, a teacher.

But in the end, they went ahead with the visit, she said after descending from the observation tower,

""We know it can happen anywhere, and we wanted to see the Empire State Building,"" Krukar said. ""It was beautiful!""","All nine people wounded during a dramatic confrontation between police and a gunman outside the  Empire State Building  were struck by bullets fired by the two officers, police said Saturday, citing ballistics evidence.",22.1578947368,0.9473684211000001,14.6842105263,medium,high,extractive,architecture

The notice for sale was posted last week after the L.A. Conservancy convinced Metro the building was of local importance.

The building will go on sale after Metro acquires it from its current owner, Señor Fish, a popular Mexican restaurant. That sale is contingent on funding from the Federal Transportation Administration.

But notices of the impending $1 sale have already been posted online in anticipation of Metro acquiring the property.

The building at 416 E. 1st St. has to be moved to make way for the Regional Connector Project, a light-rail plan intended to close gaps in the transportation system by opening three more stations downtown.

“Ultimately, relocating the building is not an easy feat. We can’t wait a year from now. We have to start getting the word out now, so folks can make plans,” said Dolores Roybal Saltarelli, a planning manager with Metro.

Although the building does not qualify for national protection, it does hold local significance, the L.A. Conservancy asserts. Formerly the Atomic Café, the building was an integral part of the neighborhood and the Los Angeles punk rock scene.

The sale will be made only under the condition the buyer is willing to assume the costs of moving the building by next year, when the Regional Connector Project is set to start.

No offers have been made yet, but Metro officials are hopeful someone will come through by the Dec. 31 deadline.

If the building is not sold by the deadline, Metro will look into incorporating parts of the building into the station or developing a memorial for the building at the new station or at a nearby location.

The lava from Kīlauea volcano moved through private property, swallowing fences and fields in its path.

Footage of the structure, which is on private property but is not a residential building, shows the molten lava incinerating it.

While the community has been preparing for the lava flow for weeks, there is nothing that can be done to prevent it from moving through the village.

For now, residents are forced to wait and watch as the lava flow inches nearer to their community. Overnight Tuesday into the early hours of Wednesday, Pāhoa residents gathered to watch the lava move closer to the village as it glowed in the distant darkness.

As of Wednesday morning, the lava flow was on course for Pāhoa Village road, though it was still several yards away. A U.S. Geological Survey map from Oct. 28 shows the close proximity of the lava flow to the community buildings of the village. It has already covered one roadway and moved through a cemetery.

""Residents down wind that may be sensitive or have respiratory problems are advised to take necessary precautions and to remain indoors,"" according to a statement. ""Additional health advisories may be issued depending upon materials involved with any fires associated with the lava flow.""

Marissa Mayer, Google’s vice president of consumer products, made the announcement Thursday at the Social-Loco conference in San Francisco.

During a demo on stage, Mayer and a co-worker showed off the ability to “enter” local businesses and see the inside of a building. Businesses can provide photos to Google, which can then be compiled into a 360-degree view of a building’s interior.

These features have been making the rounds in the rumor mill for more than a year. Back in February 2010, we heard that Google would be adding Street View-like features for retail interiors as part of Google Maps.

Business Photos could prove to be a useful tool for restaurants, bars and establishments that depend on local patronage. Many people like to check out the places they eat and drink on the web. Soon, Google users will be able to see inside these places directly from Google Maps.

Mayer says that Google Business Photos will be released in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several other countries next week, with more countries getting the feature in the following month.","Google has unveiled Business Photos for Google Maps, a new product that allows users to check out the inside of local businesses.Marissa Mayer, Google's vice president of consumer products, made",6.6666666667,0.9722222222,17.8055555556,low,high,extractive,architecture

Christine and George Donley, both 63, are finally moving home after nine months of being displaced by Hurricane Sandy. All of their possesions that they could save are now piled up in one room on the second floor as workers finish repairing their home.

By Miranda Leitsinger, Staff Writer, NBC News

BREEZY POINT, N.Y. -- Half of their neighbors are gone, piles of sand occupy lots where homes once stood, and they’re living out of one room of the two-story house they’ve owned for 10 years. This is one couple’s life nine months after Hurricane Sandy.

Christine and George Donley, both 63, desperately wanted to get home after Sandy tore through their quiet corner of New York City last Oct. 29. But now that they’ve finally returned, being among familiar things offers just some comfort.

“Sixty-three years old sleeping on a mattress on the floor is tough,” Christine said as she presented the single habitable room of their Breezy Point home. “He sleeps on the couch, and this is where we live now.

“Everyone says, ‘Oh, isn’t it great? You’re back in your house.’ I say no, because, look how I'm living. This isn’t living.”

“Oh, it’s pretty close to it,” countered George. Christine admitted that he was the more optimistic of the two of them.

They have a mini fridge, a TV and a shower that doesn’t stream water at full capacity. Their former bedroom, at the other end of the house and facing the Atlantic Ocean, is what George now calls a storage room: it’s filled with items salvaged from the first floor – a comforter, clothes, little mementos from life before.

Near the window, overlooking the sea, is a white chair with a foot rest.

“This used to be my little corner to sit and read. That was my reading corner and I'd look out onto the ocean, and life was peaceful,” said Christine, a retired school teacher. “This is, this was, our beautiful bedroom.”

George gently told her: “It will be beautiful again.”

Nearly 74,000 homes and apartments in New York and New Jersey, where Sandy made landfall, sustained damage, according to FEMA. Some 450 homes in New York were destroyed by the storm, while approximately 46,000 in New Jersey were destroyed or sustained major damage, the agency said.

The Donleys returned home July 20 after refuging in three different locations: the homes of two relatives (including one in the early days that housed 11 adults, two kids and a baby) and a rental apartment in Brooklyn.

Apart from dealing with the inconvenience of transient existence, the Donleys have spent untold hours wrestling with their insurance company over coverage, forcing them to take money out of their retirement savings for home. (They’re still challenging the firm’s decision not to pay $12,000 for foundation damage.)

They’ve watched their two daughters struggle, too, to get back to their damaged homes, helping them where they could with money, repairs and babysitting.

“It’s a loss of a year of your life, that’s what it’s like,” said George, a CPA who is mostly retired. “It’s the loss of being near your friends and neighbors, and it’s because they’re suffering from the same loss that you don’t have contact with them.”

More than 75 percent of the homes in close-knit Breezy Point were damaged in the storm – including nearly 130 that burned down in a fire triggered by Sandy’s surging waters (it was the largest blaze in New York City’s modern history).

In front of the Donley’s house is an empty lot, and another large one nearby is vacant.

“Four houses there,” George said, gesturing across the street. “They floated up like an entire team, came up, and crashed into some of the houses here. So it was one, two, three, four.”

George said that observing the rebuilding of their house has given them a lift – new appliances are waiting to be installed and they’ve ordered furniture just like their former pieces to make the downstairs feel homey. They’ve also figured out how to carve out a new room for the grandkids – one, a grandson, who was born a little more than a week ago.

But the Donleys are still awaiting final word – like many others across the city and in New Jersey – from the federal government about new building requirements for homes situated in regional flood zones.

New, preliminary federal flood maps for the region mandate that people living in vulnerable areas like the Donleys will have to elevate their homes a certain number of feet – about four in their case – or face steep increases in their insurance. Some homeowners will have to get new kinds of foundations, too, among other adjustments.

Christine and George Donley, both 63, are finally moving home after nine months of being displaced by Hurricane Sandy.

The requirements could go into effect for all homeowners in the Breezy area, though some whose homes were significantly damaged or demolished will have to do the work sooner.

“We were living in the apartment and we’re saying, well, maybe we won’t go back in until we find out how high we have to go,” Christine said. Ultimately, “we don’t have two to three years for them to decide how high we have to go. We can’t afford to pay the rent and pay a mortgage while they’re deciding.”

Elevating is an expense that can range from tens of thousands of dollars to more than $100,000 depending on the type of residence and foundation.

Returning to the Breezy community has made dealing with all of the uncertainty bearable.

“We’re able to see and spend time with our friends and neighbors who are here and we’re sharing (our) struggling stories with them,” he said. “It’s good to see them.”

A neighbor and good friend, Catherine Palummeri, had tidied up the Donley home and put up a big sign reading, “welcome home,” to greet the couple upon their return. “I couldn't wait for them to come back,” she said.

“You need people, that’s it … let’s get back to normal,” said Palummeri, who moved back in late March. “The worst part was having no neighbors … you had no interaction.”

Also giving the Donleys a boost: family time on the beach.

“The water has been beautiful. The beach has been great,” George said.

As she sat in a rocking chair on her new deck, where a city building department flyer was posted listing their home’s condition and new insulation clung to the outside walls, Christine said they would make it through the storm – one that she said she would not “honor” by calling it by its given name.

“We will get through this,” she said. “I am stronger than the storm. I am. It took me a long time to say that, but I said it the other night. I am stronger.”","BREEZY POINT, N.Y. -- Half of their neighbors are gone, piles of sand occupy lots where homes once stood, and they’re living out of one room of the two-story house they’ve owned for 10 years.

By Katie Cannon, NBC News:

A project 90 years in the making had better be impressive, and the Metropolitan Transport Authority's $4.5 billion Second Avenue Subway project does not disappoint.

The undertaking, which began in 2007, can be found nine stories underneath the streets of Manhattan. It’s the first line to be built in New York City since 1932, and the initial phase will run from 96th street to 63rd street. There are plans to eventually run the line all the way to lower Manhattan.

MTA photographer Patrick Cashin began making pictures of the construction as soon as there was a hole large enough to venture into.

“I think when you’re down there for all of 10 seconds, you know that this is a dangerous place to be,” Cashin said in an interview published on Flickr's blog.

Despite the danger, he visits the site every few months to document the progress of this engineering feat.

See more pictures on the MTA's Flickr page.

Sept. 22, 2011: Workers completed tunneling for the first phase of the Second Avenue Subway when the project's tunnel boring machine reached the Lexington Av-63 St station, breaking into the existing subway system. The 485-ton, 450-foot-long TBM used a 22-foot diameter cutter head to mine 7,789 linear feet in two tunnels, averaging approximately 60 linear feet a day.

Things sound different in a place where no one goes.

Words echo off walls in empty rooms.

Real or imagined creatures scurry through mysterious puddles.

Shadows fall in strange places.

Time doesn’t stop in abandoned buildings, it just moves differently -- and before their ultimate demise, photographer Matthew Christopher is determined to document the life, purpose, and deterioration of these structures.

Photographer Matthew Christopher , Abandoned America, Â photographs abandoned sites across America.Â He documents the lost history and soul of structures as varied as homes, steel plants and asylums.Â Â Â Â

They aren't just brick and mortar, wood and windows -- Christopher believes the abandoned buildings dotting America’s landscape also have something of a soul. He wants us to remember our country’s neglected factories, schools, churches, and hospitals before they are gone forever.

He started this project 10 years ago while working in the mental health field. Some of his first photographs were inside a deserted asylum.

Since then, he’s documented dozens of abandoned buildings across the country and presented their stories at galleries and on his website, abandonedamerica.us. The goal, he says, is to highlight the economic failures leading to their downfall and the social impact on communities fractured by the closing of these neighborhood mainstays.

We met recently at the partially deserted Holmesburg Prison near Philadelphia. It was eerie, but there was a certain beauty in the stillness and things left behind. Inside, it reminded me of a quote by French composer Claude Debussy who famously said, “Music is the space between the notes.” The places Christopher photographs tell their stories with silence and extraordinary light – the spaces between the life and death of a building.

His pictures make me feel like someone told me a secret.

Christopher is a thoughtful man, melancholy in his assessment of decay -- and I feel lucky he shared his art and technique with us. I am also grateful to NBC News photographer Bob Riggio for documenting our adventure inside a place almost no one goes.

Built in 1875, it is Napa’s first stone building and oldest surviving commercial building, recognized by the National Parks Service as one of 94 California sites important to Chinese-American history.

Over the years, the building has housed a brewery, a boarding house, a saloon, and the Sam Kee Laundry, founded by its namesake, a mid-19th century immigrant from China.

In the landmark 1887 case, “In Re Sam Kee, On Habeas Corpus,” Sam Kee challenged the constitutionality of a discriminatory city ordinance which made it illegal to have a laundry within the city limits, and won at the Ninth District Circuit Court.

“It's a memorable part of California history when Chinese immigrants faced virulent discrimination and were denied a livelihood,” said Margaret Fung, Executive Director of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), “Kee stood up for his rights and successfully challenged the town's discriminatory ordinance creating a ‘laundry-free’ zone in 1887.""

The building currently houses Vintner's Collective, which did not respond to NBC News' request for comment, but notes on its Facebook page that the building has been badly damaged and they are temporarily moving operations.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, the incoming leader of the Senate Dems, predicted on “Meet the Press” that infrastructure was one of a few issues where his party and the Trump White House could collaborate.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi offered similar hopes, stating that “investing in infrastructure is an important priority of his,” and predicting, “We can work together to quickly pass a robust infrastructure jobs bill.”

EPA delayed warning Flint residents over water crisis for 7 month

Democrats and Republicans already agree that vital parts of the country are falling into ruin. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates we need to spend a staggering $3.6 trillion to fix the nation’s crumbling transportation, energy and clean water systems.

The engineers issue dire warnings every few years, which the public tends to ignore until an emergency strikes, like the recent water crisis in Flint, Mich., or the 2007 collapse of a bridge in Minnesota during rush hour that killed 13 and injured 145.

In addition to the obvious danger of allowing infrastructure to collapse, politicians of both parties agree with economists that repairing and upgrading infrastructure generates thousands of much-needed jobs, including for designers, engineers, lawyers, planners and a vast number of titles in the skilled and semiskilled construction trades — welders, steam fitters, steelworkers, bricklayers, laborers and so on.

But the parties are proposing radically different — and largely incompatible — strategies for launching a rebuilding campaign.

Donald Trump threatens to jail flag burners

As a candidate, Hillary Clinton argued for a $275 billion rebuilding program, with $25 billion of the money used to start an infrastructure bank that would extend loans to state and local governments and public agencies like the Port Authority. While the funding mechanism wasn’t entirely clear, at least some of the money in the Clinton proposal would have come from a tax on the nation’s ultrawealthy.

It wasn’t a radically original proposal: Some version of the Clinton plan has been circulating in Democratic circles for years.

President Obama spent much of his first term trying to persuade reluctant Republican lawmakers and governors to spend $105 billion in stimulus money to invest in high-speed rail projects. Many of the most intriguing projects got shot down by GOP governors, who publicly spurned proposals (and federal money) to build rail lines linking Tampa and Orlando in Florida or Milwaukee and Madison in Wisconsin, calling the projects wasteful boondoggles.

That could change when Trump takes office; the billionaire businessman has pledged to embark on a building spree even bigger than the one Clinton suggested. “I would say at least double her numbers, and you’re really going to need more than that,” he said in August.

Minnesota bridge collapse survivor charged with helping ISIS

But Trump has proposed a dramatically different funding stream than Clinton did. Instead of raising taxes or floating bonds to raise money, Trump would provide tax credits to private firms that agree to finance and build infrastructure projects.

It’s not a crazy idea: Much of the country’s infrastructure — from the New York City subway system to modern Wi-Fi and cable telecommunications networks — was built by private firms. And there’s sound research behind the idea that private companies can be more efficient than government when it comes to raising and deploying money for infrastructure.

But progressives — notably, economist Paul Krugman — have already taken to calling the Trump plan a plot to privatize the nation’s public infrastructure and reap vast profits by charging bridge and highway tolls, water and sewer fees and the like.

Those complaints will shift into high gear when it becomes clear that Trump intends to link the infrastructure plan to a tax cut for American corporations that currently have billions of dollars in profits stashed overseas. And there’s a valid concern that private companies will gravitate toward building in well-off areas that generate lots of revenue instead of areas like Flint where lower-income Americans live.

N.Y. pols announce $250G to help prevent deportations under Trump

Schumer, Pelosi and other Democrats will have their work cut out for them. They should resist the temptation to grandstand over the private-sector-oriented nature of the Trump plan — he did win the election — and focus deal-making on getting a separate, wholly public infrastructure bank set up and properly funded.

It’s the best way to avoid yet another decade wasted on paralyzing fights that leave America with rickety bridges, rutted roads, leaky pipes and unsafe railroads.

More than 130 smoke-eaters battled a suspicious three-alarm blaze in a vacant commercial building in Brooklyn Sunday morning, officials said.

The fire — which FDNY Chief of Department James Leonard deemed suspicious — erupted in the building on 86th St., near New Utrecht Ave. in Bensonhurst, around 7:11 a.m., he said. Nobody was hurt.

Leonard said the circumstances of the fire were dubious because the building is vacant.

“We had very heavy fire on arrival in an unoccupied building, which that by itself needs to be investigated,"" he said.

The second floor of the building collapsed an hour-and-a-half after the fire began. Leonard said the rest of the structure could also collapse.

Neighborhood residents said the inferno was visible for blocks.

""The fire could be seen almost a mile away,"" said Giti Wiss, who walks around the area every day.

""It's pretty bad. It looks scary,” said George Safee, a 16-year-old student at Fort Hamilton High School. “It's one of the worst I've seen.""

Allen Henson and the owners agreed that as long as he stays out of the Midtown landmark, they will drop their lawsuit over the topless model photograph that he took on the building's Observation Deck in 2013.

After appearing in Manhattan Supreme Court with his wife, Carlicia, Henson said the pact is a victory.

""They never had a case. There was no trespassing and they had no proof it was used for commercial purposes,"" Henson told reporters.

He also said there are plenty of other tall buildings in Manhattan to use as a backdrop for his pictures.

""This is a victory for artists, a victory for women. This is a victory for New York,"" Henson said in a statement, adding:

""We won. Photographers of NY, the Empire is free game.""

The building's owners said, ""The Empire State Building is private property and will always enforce the rules governing all building visitors, which are designed to ensure a safe, family-friendly experience for everyone. Mr. Henson's actions have rendered him permanently barred from entering the Empire State Building.""

Building owners sued Henson for $1 million last year. They charged him with illegally getting entry to the Observation Deck by purchasing a routine admission ticket and not first getting their permission to do a commercial shot. They said the photo hurt the building's reputation as a family-friendly tourist attraction.

Henson said the 2013 shot was part of an art project he was doing called Boobs Around Town. He accused the building owners of defaming him.

The issue heated up last month when building owners went back to court seeking a permanent injunction against Henson. They said he was planning to return to the Observation Deck because he had started to advertise for models who were not ""afraid of heights.""

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Geoffrey Wright signed a temporary restraining order barring Henson from doing any more photo shoots at the ESB until their next date in court. Henson later made bigger headlines by bringing a bevy of topless models to the courthouse.

A draft of the peace pact between the parties says Henson can use his 2013 photos for commercial purposes but Henson, his employees and people ""acting in concert"" are ""permanently enjoined from entering the building"" and the court will keep jurisdiction to enforce that ban.

The woman, who had apparently taken a handful of anti-anxiety pills, told police that she wanted to “end it all” as she sat on the rooftop edge of a five-story building on First Ave. by E. Seventh St. just after 7:40 p.m. Sunday, police said.

“She simply said that she wanted to end it all. We’d come to find out later from her friend ... that it was related at least in part, if not entirely, to a breakup with a boyfriend,” said NYPD Officer Joseph Wallach.

Wallach, Lt. Robert Mortensen, and officers Vincent Lapenta and Brandon Lopez responded to the scene, and saw the woman at the roof’s edge, her feet dangling.

“There was no ledge, no lift, no barrier. It was just a flat roof,” Wallach said. “When she edged closer, we just knew she was serious.”

Wallach got an opening to grab the woman after she answered a cell phone call from a friend.

“It’s scary, but you don’t really think about it,” he said of all the danger involved in such a rescue. “It was really great that her friend happened to call her and she answered the phone.”

Police found just 15 pills left in a 60-pill bottle of clonazepam — the generic name for the anti-anxiety drug Klonopin — in her apartment, cops said.

ALBANY — City health officials plan to test for elevated levels of lead dust at up to 20 buildings owned by an East Village landlord notorious for allegations of tenant harassment, the Daily News has learned.

The testing is being undertaken at the urging of local elected officials who charge that “reckless construction” taking place in buildings owned by Raphael Toledano is endangering the health of tenants.

“The situation is outrageous and unacceptable,” said State Sen. Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan).

STATE PROBING LANDLORD ACCUSED OF STRONG-ARMING TENANTS

Hoylman and seven other elected officials from the area, including Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer and Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-Manhattan), sent a letter to the city Health Department this week asking for tests at the buildings owned by Toledano’s Brookhill Properties.

They said initial testing at three Toledano buildings — 514 E. 12th St.; 235 East 5th St.; and 233 East 5th St. — showed potentially hazardous levels of lead dust in common areas.

“There have been layers of dust in my building and apartment — so much that I was told by my doctor to wear a dust mask in my own house,” said Holly Slayton, 42, who lives at the E. 12th St. building.

City Health Department spokesman Christopher Miller confirmed the agency will conduct tests at the properties. More than 100 people live in the targeted buildings.

A Brooklyn house fire spread to two other homes and a church in mere minutes Sunday, an FDNY spokesman said.

The six-alarm blaze started just before 6:30 p.m. at a home on Arlington Ave. by Elton St. in Cypress Hills, and the flames quickly jumped to the other houses and the exterior of the nearby Presbyterian Church of the Crossroads, FDNY officials said..

Firefighters put out the church fire, but the stubborn house fires kept them busy into the night. Four firefighters suffered minor injuries, and one civilian was treated for smoke inhalation, FDNY Chief of Department James Leonard said.

FDNY work to put under control a 5th alarm fire in a private home in Brooklyn at 270 Arlington ave.

“They're all wood-frame buildings. They're very tight together, a large body of fire, the fire extends rapidly in these types of buildings,” Leonard said. ""We think the fire started in the garage in the rear, but that's under investigation.”

Earlier Sunday, four kittens were saved from a two-alarm fire in the Bronx.

The tenants of a Queens apartment building were greeted Sunday morning by a 7-foot black snake abandoned by its owner by a garbage chute.

Police officers came to a Flushing apartment building around 8 a.m. Sunday after residents called to say that the large python was slithering inside a cage — and the owner was nowhere to be found, cops said.

No one was injured by the deserted snake.

Cops bagged the reptile and first tried to drop it off at the Alley Pond Environmental Center, where they turned them away.

“From what the police woman told me, it was pretty large!” a worker at the environmental center told the News, adding that she referred the officers to the Bayside Animal Clinic.

Cops dropped the python off at the animal clinic before the snake’s owner came to claim it and took it away.

Not both.”

That, he said, is “una cavolata,” an Italian word that translates literally as cabbage soup and figuratively as the same thing exiting a horse.

The devil, as always, will be in the dollars and details, but it’s a fine vision of where to take the city after a decade when too many New Yorkers felt like progress happened to them, not for them. A booming neighborhood doesn’t feel like a boon when the price of groceries shoots up along with the rent.

But change, even change that’s good for the city, feels like something else when it’s blocking your light and air, or rattling your bedroom in the morning.

Tuesday, de Blasio pointed as a model to the housing plan of Mayor Ed Koch, who said then “we’re creating more than just apartments — we’re re-creating neighborhoods.” But Koch was able to do that because many parts of the city had hollowed out, leaving empty spaces and buildings.

Today, New York is bursting at the seams and land is so scarce that one big part of de Blasio’s plan involves a multi-billion-dollar proposal — that Gov. Cuomo has already poured cold water on — to cover the huge rail yard in Sunnyside and then entice private developers to create a neighborhood with 11,250 units of affordable housing.

Beyond Sunnyside, the core of his plan involves zoning changes allowing bigger new buildings in various pockets of the city — and requiring developers to provide permanently affordable new housing (along with market-rate units) in exchange for the extra height.

That’s a jackpot — assuming things get built. But before they put up seven or eight figures, developers have to be confident that the numbers will add up — that the increased development rights (along with government subsidies, especially in places like East New York) will cover the cost of the below-market units.

For the city, there’s little downside: If nothing gets built in some places, we’re no worse off than now. And where buildings do go up, de Blasio will have proven he can collect more affordable housing eggs without killing the development goose. And that we can get new market-rate housing, and affordable units along with them, outside the confines of Mayor Bloomberg’s luxury city.

The New York Times this week labeled de Blasio’s approach “Bloombergism with a twist,” as — like his predecessor — the new mayor banks on private development to pay for his promise of new affordable housing. The twist: De Blasio would do much more to ensure construction benefits current residents, not just those drawn in as so-called luxury buildings rise and coffee houses and craft beer bars spring up like mushrooms in their shadows.

I wrote last year that “the simple way out of this Chinese finger trap, where the more subsidized housing we have, the more outrageously expensive it gets for everyone not lucky enough to have it, is (building up) — an approach largely favored by an unlikely coalition of developers, trade unionists and affordable housing advocates.”

In short, to convince developers they can still profit while giving a bigger cut of potential profits to New Yorkers lucky enough to win the affordable housing lottery, and to increase supply enough to help relieve the pressure on the rest of us. And to convince New Yorkers already in the places he’s aiming to transform that years of construction is in their interests.

That’s a tough sell after a 50-year cycle in which, to put it crudely, residents who hung on or moved in and fought to improve neighborhoods damaged by white flight, then found themselves pushed out by white influx as the city became more attractive.

Taking the gentrification bull by the horns, de Blasio credited two decades of declining crime with drawing people to the city, bringing with them “jobs and amenities, more activities, safer streets. The problem comes when we reach the tipping point . . . when New Yorkers get priced out of their own neighborhoods.”

Who could disagree? But let’s be honest: As long as people want to be here, someone will always be pricing someone else out . And any plan for a better future will encounter fierce resistance from people who like where they live now, and can afford it.

As much as I like de Blasio’s vision, I wouldn’t trade years of noisy construction intended to dramatically change my corner of Brooklyn to provide lower rents in a few years, mostly to people who aren’t even here yet.

At least 32 of the 58 people on board died when Flight GE235 clipped a highway overpass and sailed into the Keelung Riverin New Taipei City Wednesday. Fifteen people were rescued, leaving 12 people missing.

Pilot Liao Chien-tsung and his unidentified co-pilot are among the dead, Taiwan's aviation regulator said.

Cockpit recordings showed Liao cried “mayday, mayday, engine flameout!” just before impact,USA Today reported.

""He really tried everything he could,"" Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je said of Liao, his voice breaking with sobs.

Dramatic video showed the crashing plane’s wing hit a taxi on the road. The driver and his passenger were majorly injured — but they were the only two hurt on the ground.

Taiwanese media reported that it appeared Liao, who had nearly 5,000 hours of flying under his belt, had fought desperately to steer his aircraft between apartment blocks and commercial buildings.

""The pilot's immediate reaction saved many people,"" said Chris Lin, brother of one of the survivors.

The cause of the crash has not been determined. A flameout — the pilot’s final call over the radio — can occur when the fuel supply to an engine is interrupted or when there is faulty combustion, but twin-engined aircraft can usually keep flying with one engine.

Rescue teams continued their hunt for the missing dozen Thursday, but officials said they expect the death toll to rise.

""At the moment, things don't look too optimistic,"" Taipei Fire Department official Wu Jun-hong told reporters at the scene Wednesday. ""Those in the front of the plane are likely to have lost their lives.""

Many of the passengers on the Taipei-to-Kinmen Island flight were from mainland China.

A TransAsia official said the airline would give the families of those killed $38,198 for funeral expenses and $6,345 to each of the injured.

The Wednesday crash the second in a little more than six months for privately held TransAsia. Another ATR-72 crashed on final approach to Taiwan's Penghu Islands in July, killing 48 people and injuring 10.

Cuban guards stand at close intervals on the street outside, and islanders line up by the thousands each year for a shot at a coveted visa.

The gleaming U.S. Interests Section suddenly is poised to become an even more important presence in Cuba as the two countries negotiate the first phase of their historic detente — transforming the complex into a full embassy that would reflect the Obama administration’s hopes of new influence on the communist island.

Roberta Jacobson, assistant U.S. secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, will be the highest known U.S. administration official to visit in decades when she comes next month for annual talks on migration that will now also focus on the details of re-establishing full diplomatic relations.

The discussions are expected to cover expanding staffing in the two countries’ interests sections and letting diplomats travel outside their respective capitals without having to ask permission.

Also part of the reopening of the embassy: symbolic measures such as raising the American flag on the Malecon.

“Opening an embassy is a symbolic gesture, but symbols are really important,” John Caulfield, who was Interests Section chief from 2011 to 2014, said by phone from Jacksonville, Florida, where he retired.

“This is a pretty powerful symbol by our president that we want to have a more normal relationship with Cuba despite the fact that we have the obvious differences,” he added.

Cuba’s interests section is a stately manor in Washington’s Adams Morgan neighborhood. It, too, stands to become an embassy.

Diplomats say privately that Washington hopes to boost staffing in Havana, currently at about 50 Americans and 300 Cuban workers, as more American travelers and trade delegates are expected to come here under new rules to be set by the White House softening the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba.

An agreement could also ease or scrap rules that require U.S. diplomats to channel all requests through Cuba’s Foreign Ministry; the diplomats would be able to deal directly with at least some other branches of government.

The U.S. Interests Section has often been a flashpoint for conflict, and its decades of hybrid status reflect the dysfunctional relationship between the two deeply intertwined countries.

The building first opened as an embassy in 1953, the same year Fidel Castro launched an ill-fated assault on a barracks that is considered the onset of the Cuban Revolution.

Eight years later, with Castro then in power, the countries broke ties and Switzerland stepped in to safeguard both the embassy and the ambassador’s residence, a sprawling, immaculately groomed estate in Havana’s finest neighborhood.

After the break, Washington was without a presence in Cuba until 1977, when the interests sections were opened under President Jimmy Carter. The missions technically operate under the aegis of the “protecting power” Switzerland.

Cuba later built the adjacent “Anti-Imperialist Plaza,” which has hosted nationalist rallies where Castro gave long speeches railing against Washington, and concerts demanding the return of the Cuban intelligence agents whom the U.S. freed last week as part of the detente. Huge marches streamed past the Interests Section in 2000 to demand the return of the young Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez.

On the wall of a conference room in the mission hangs the bronze head of an eagle that topped the nearby USS Maine monument until it was ripped down in a 1961 anti-Yankee protest following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. The wings and body sit in a musty Cuban museum storage room awaiting a possible reunion with the head on the day that Havana and Washington become friends.

In 2006, U.S. diplomats abruptly installed an electronic billboard that scrolled messages extolling democracy and human rights to Cubans on the street below. An outraged Cuban government erected dozens of black flags to obscure the signs.

“The consequence of that was, for years, they did not allow us to import lightbulbs,” Caulfield recalled with a chuckle.

The U.S. Interests Section is closely watched by cameras and guards on both sides, a function of both the longtime tensions and general increased security at American diplomatic missions following 9/11. Cuban police make pedestrians cross the street to use another sidewalk, and no parking is allowed.

Some neighbors say they love living nearby: Nobody ever gets robbed, and the employees and visa-seekers support local businesses that were allowed to open under President Raul Castro’s economic reforms of recent years.

“Because the whole area is so well guarded, it’s very safe,” said Pedro Hernandez, 73, who runs a modest snack bar out of his home. “There are no problems with crime of any kind, and that’s very good for us.”

American diplomats say low-level harassment was routine for many years, as Cuba restricted their movements and activities and dragged its feet on permission to do standard maintenance. Cuban state media routinely portrayed the building as a den of spies.

Both sides gradually moved toward a remarkably civil relationship in recent years. The electronic sign came down in 2009, as did the black flags — though they still fly on special occasions. The countries started granting diplomatic travel permission more easily. Envoys exchanged home phone numbers and even dined together occasionally. Long-stalled talks on migration and restoring mail service resumed.

Once details of the new diplomatic relationship are worked, actually turning the mission into an embassy requires little more than changing a few signs and ordering a new letterhead, experts said.

“A few strokes of the pen and that’s it,” said Wayne Smith, who was a junior diplomat in Cuba when relations were severed in 1961 and returned to head the Interests Section in the late 1970s.

Some who served in the U.S. Interests Section are awaiting the change with a mixture of excitement and wistfulness at not being here for the transition.

“I would have loved to be there to raise that flag,” Caulfield said.",The United States’ seven-story mission building will become its new embassy as the countries work to re-establish diplomatic relations.,48.4166666667,0.9166666667000001,3.0833333333,high,medium,mixed,architecture

The Wichita Airport Authority received reports of a crash at 9:46 a.m. Central Time Thursday, Airport Police and Fire Chief Roger Xanders said.

The small plane is now in pieces on the roof and on the ground, authorities said.

Some 100 people were inside the FlightSafety International building at the time of the crash, fire officials said. The business provides flight training and has several simulators inside.

Wichita Police Deputy Chief John Speer said the crash was an accident and ""not an intentional act.""

Heavy equipment will be brought in Friday to remove portions of the building so firefighters can reach the victims, Wichita Fire Chief Ronald Blackwell said. The work is expected to take a couple of days.

The pilot of the Beechcraft King Air twin-turboprop plane reported losing engine power shortly after takeoff and crashed when trying to return to the runway, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. The plane was headed to Mena, Ark.

53-year-old Mark Goldstein, who had a great deal of flying experience, has been identified as the pilot, according to KAKE. Goldstein is one of the four people who were killed.

Police will not release the names of the others killed until their families have been notified by police and chaplains, Speer said. Three of the victims are local and one is from out of the country.

Firefighters were pulled from inside the building after concerns of possible collapse, officials said. Ceilings and at least one wall were reported collapsed, according to the airport.

Emergency workers will have to wait until early tomorrow morning to collect remains. Although FAA investigators are on scene, firefighters must wait for NTSB officials to arrive this evening and secures the building, Wichita Fire Chief Ron Blackwell said.

""We are concerned for everyone's safety, including our first responders,"" he said. Going through the building ""will be a long a complicated process.""

Three of the victims were people inside the building and were found inside the same flight simulator, according to authorities. One victim was found on the roof.

One person is in serious condition and one is fair, KWCH-TV reported.

Three people were taken to Via Christi St. Francis Hospital in good condition. They have since been treated and released, according to The Wichita Eagle.

Doug Nolte, city police spokesman, said in a news release that three of the victims were from the Wichita area and one was from another country.

Officials originally reported that about four or five people were missing but they have since been accounted for.

There's still a lot of work to be done to ease this tragedy, Mayor Carl Brewer said.

""We've been saddened and our entire community has been affected,"" he said at a press conference, promising the city will do all it can for the victims.

Black smoke and flames could be seen billowing from the crash site.

""They finally got the fire out. You can't tell it was a plane, it looks like a go-kart frame,"" Ryan Weatherby told the Daily News

Weatherby owns an airplane detailing service and said he was working nearby when he saw the smoke. He feared for the plane's pilot and was shaken by the crash.

""I don't see how they would have gotten out of that on top of the building,"" Weatherby said. ""It was definitely a scary situation.""

FlightSafety will continue to work with investigators and could not provide more details, the company said in a statement.

The termination of the contract is the latest in a series of blows between Skanska and Ratner in an ongoing legal dispute over delays and cost overruns at the Atlantic Yards building.

A company spokesperson said Forest City had refused to address a number of issues the team was facing, including an allegedly flawed design for the 32-story tower.

""We could not continue to incur millions of dollars in extra costs with little hope that Forest City would take responsibility for fixing the significant commercial and design issues on the project,"" said Skanska USA COO Richard Kennedy in a statement.

Skanska recently stopped work at the Atlantic Yards site, idling more than 150 union workers. Skanska and Forest City traded lawsuits last month, each blaming the other for the snafus at the project.

Ratner's camp quickly fired back following termination of the contract, saying Skanska was just trying to gain financial leverage and get a better deal from Forest City by halting construction at the site.

""These are deplorable and disappointing tactics that show remarkable indifference to the wellbeing of these workers and the project,"" said MaryAnne Gilmartin, president and CEO of Forest City. ""We will continue to rigorously pursue our options through the courts to get [the building] built.""

Construction has been stalled at the site since August, when Skanska shut down the Brooklyn Navy Yard factory where modules for the tower were being assembled. Now, it looks as though the building will remain unfinished for the foreseeable future.

Nohmul sat in the middle of a privately owned sugar cane field, and lacked the even stone sides frequently seen in reconstructed or better-preserved pyramids. But Awe said the builders could not possibly have mistaken the pyramid mound, which is about 100 feet tall, for a natural hill because the ruins were well-known and the landscape there is naturally flat.

""These guys knew that this was an ancient structure. It's just bloody laziness"", Awe said.

Photos from the scene showed backhoes clawing away at the pyramid's sloping sides, leaving an isolated core of limestone cobbles at the center, with what appears to be a narrow Mayan chamber dangling above one clawed-out section.

""Just to realize that the ancient Maya acquired all this building material to erect these buildings, using nothing more than stone tools and quarried the stone, and carried this material on their heads, using tump lines,"" said Awe. ""To think that today we have modern equipment, that you can go and excavate in a quarry anywhere, but that this company would completely disregard that and completely destroyed this building. Why can't these people just go and quarry somewhere that has no cultural significance? It's mind-boggling.""

Belizean police said they are conducting an investigation and criminal charges are possible. The Nohmul complex sits on private land, but Belizean law says that any pre-Hispanic ruins are under government protection.

The Belize community-action group Citizens Organized for Liberty Through Action called the destruction of the archaeological site ""an obscene example of disrespect for the environment and history.""

It is not the first time it's happened in Belize, a country of about 350,000 people that is largely covered in jungle and dotted with hundreds of Mayan ruin sites, though few as large as Nohmul.

Norman Hammond, an emeritus professor of archaeology at Boston University who worked in Belizean research projects in the 1980s, wrote in an email that ""bulldozing Maya mounds for road fill is an endemic problem in Belize (the whole of the San Estevan center has gone, both of the major pyramids at Louisville, other structures at Nohmul, many smaller sites), but this sounds like the biggest yet.""

Arlen Chase, chairman of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Central Florida, said, ""Archaeologists are disturbed when such things occur, but there is only a very limited infrastructure in Belize that can be applied to cultural heritage management.""

""Unfortunately, they (destruction of sites) are all too common, but not usually in the center of a large Maya site,"" Chase wrote.

He said there had probably still been much to learn from the site. ""A great deal of archaeology was undertaken at Nohmul in the '70s and '80s, but this only sampled a small part of this large center.""

Belize isn't the only place where the handiwork of the far-flung and enormously prolific Maya builders is being destroyed. The ancient Mayas spread across southeastern Mexico and through Guatemala, Honduras and Belize.

""I don't think I am exaggerating if I say that every day a Maya mound is being destroyed for construction in one of the countries where the Maya lived,"" wrote Francisco Estrada-Belli, a professor at Tulane University's Anthropology Department.

""Unfortunately, this destruction of our heritage is irreversible but many don't take it seriously,"" he added. ""The only way to stop it is by showing that it is a major crime and people can and will go to jail for it.""

Robert Rosenswig, an archaeologist at the State University of New York at Albany, described the difficult and heartbreaking work of trying to salvage information at the nearby site of San Estevan following similar destruction around 2005.

""Bulldozing damage at San Estevan is extensive and the site is littered with Classic period potsherds,"" he wrote in an academic paper describing the scene. ""We spent a number of days at the beginning of the 2005 season trying to figure out the extent of the damage .... after scratching our heads for many days, a bulldozer showed up and we realized that what appear to be mounds, when overgrown with chest-high vegetation, are actually recently bulldozed garbage piles.""

However small the compensation, bulldozing pyramids is one very brutal way of revealing the inner cores of the structures, which were often built up in periodic stages of construction.

""The one advantage of this massive destruction, to the core site, is that the remains of early domestic activity are now visible on the surface,"" Rosenswig wrote.","A construction company has essentially destroyed one of Belize's largest Mayan pyramids with backhoes and bulldozers to extract crushed rock for a road-building project, authorities announced on Monday.",31.5151515152,1.0,33.0,medium,high,extractive,architecture

Talk about prime real estate.

A half-demolished apartment building now stands smack dab in the middle of a new roadway thanks to a Chinese couple that refused to move.

Luo Baogen and his wife balked at relocating from their home in the city of Wenling, Zhejiang province, eastern China, because they believed the government did not offer them enough compensation, China Daily reported.

Their neighbors are all gone, but many of the unoccupied rooms are still intact to make sure that the property is safe for the couple to live in.

The road paved through the Xiazhangyang village is not yet open.

The dilapidated building, however, proves to be quite a bizarre sight for the select motorists who have been given a chance to drive around the structure.

Private ownership laws have tightened in the People’s Republic of China in recent years.

It’s illegal to raze a property without the owner’s prior consent.

Those who refuse to leave are dubbed “Nail Householders,” referring to a nail that is nearly impossible to remove from wood.

Baogen and his wife are not the first couple to thwart public construction by refusing to move.

Hong Chunqin, 75, and her husband Kung first accepted about $10,000 to move from their home in Taizhou, Zhejiang province, eastern China, early this year.

They later backtracked, forcing developers to build a road around their property.",A half-demolished apartment building now stands smack dab in the middle of a new roadway thanks to a Chinese couple that refused to move.,10.962962963,1.0,27.0,low,high,extractive,architecture

You never know who lives next door. Like Steve Jobs tinkering with computers in his parents’ garage, Nirvana jamming in some Seattle basement or Andy Warhol sketching soup cans in a Union Square loft, great things happen all around us. Architects with vision have to begin somewhere, too.

Haiko Cornelissen founded his own architecture firm in a two-bedroom apartment across from a church on 34th Ave. in Jackson Heights, Queens. Born in Amsterdam, Cornelissen and his wife, Becky, have lived in the neighborhood more than six years. After renting for three years, they bought their apartment for $225,000. Almost immediately, with his wife pregnant, Cornelissen did what all young architects want to do. He turned his home into a calling card.

“I’m not trying to design beautiful things,” says Cornelissen. “I’m trying to design beautiful innovations. Too many architects today are just concerned with building beautiful things, but they enhance nothing. I want to build ideas and forms that are repeated, that improve how we live.”

Starting with the average two-bedroom in the average brick co-op, Cornelissen updated the urban living experience for his client — in this case his wife, who loves to read, cook and entertain. The focal point of the home is a chef’s island made of plaster that looks like a modern form of an ancient chimney. An IKEA kitchen is altered to wedge out and back to fit appliances, store objects and make way for a window on the apartment’s western wall, allowing light. For the middle of the room, Cornelissen created an aluminum dining table topped with grass.

“When Becky was in school in Paris, we lived in a dorm-type room,” says Cornelissen, of what he called a “picNYC Table.” “When people would come over, we would take food outside and eat on a picnic table or grass. We had no space inside. I wanted to bring rural into the urban apartment. Just the smell of grass in a New York City apartment is different. It changes how we think of dining. I never had a table I had to take care of. Having to cut your table with scissors is a transforming experience.”

Titled “Wall-All Apartment,” much of the home is tucked away into the walls. A former closet that can be closed off is used as an office. A symmetrical upside-down door stores audio/visual equipment. A hallway door gives way to the apartment’s private space — two bedrooms and bathroom.

Workers were attempting to lift the unit into one of the Madison Avenue office building’s control rooms when the rigging strap holding it broke, sending it plummeting to the street around 10:45 a.m., said a source familiar with the investigation.

The metal rectangular unit struck the side of the building multiple times as it fell, sending glass and building debris raining down. The unit landed in the middle of Madison Avenue between 38th and 39th streets.

“It sounded like a freight train,” said Milo Avidane, who watched from his apartment across the street as a cloud of smoke rose from the accident site.

“They were rigging the HVAC unit through a hole on the top floor, and and it never made it into the building,” Avidane said. “It landed smack in the middle of Madison — right in front of the restaurant on the bottom floor.”

Another witness said, “The load on the crane started swinging like it was unstable, and then it crashed into the building,” adding that he could hear construction workers yelling right before the unit fell.

“Thank goodness this occurs at this hour, on a weekend, when there were not many people around” Mayor de Blasio said at a press conference.

“Obviously, this is a very serious incident. There will be a full investigation,” he said.

Five motorists and two construction workers were treated at Bellevue Hospital and NYU Medical Center for minor injuries, officials said.

Three others who were hurt refused medical attention.

First responders evacuated Madison Avenue from 37th to 39th streets out of fear that the the building’s facade could collapse. They also closed several other nearby streets to cars and pedestrians to help with the cleanup.

“I don’t believe you can’t make an efficient and proper prewar building, and I don’t believe you can’t make a funky and cool new building,” says Woody Heller, who heads capital markets for Savills Studley.

Heller points to the Taconic/Thor redevelopment at 837 Washington St., opposite the High Line, as “a funky new building designed to offer what tenants covet.”

At the same time, Heller notes that real estate investor L&L Holdings has created a new category of building stock: “Prewar Class A.”

“There is absolutely no reason that prewar buildings can’t offer charm or ambiance and also [be redeveloped] into a legitimate and proper office,” Heller adds, citing 200 Fifth Ave. — home to Mario Batali’s Italian food hall Eataly — and 114 Fifth Ave. as examples of older properties that were served up vacant and completely reinvented by L&L.

Still, Heller is not a fan of many of the side-street loft and office buildings that once housed very few workers doing light manufacturing and are now being dusted off for tech companies. “Because of a lack of forethought,” he explains, some of those repurposed as offices result in lines of workers waiting for slow, small elevators.

“Now you are taking a benching office use, which is the highest of all possible densities, and can’t expect one of these poor old buildings — that wasn’t built from an infrastructure standpoint — to handle the workers,” Heller explains. “Unless you re-envision by putting in infrastructure, they don’t have a fighting chance to serve the current intention.”

At 130 Fifth Ave., Heller recalls a client who added an additional elevator sleeve in the main lobby and a bigger cab. Similarly, he says, “It’s not impossible to add another stall to a bathroom by adding four feet.”

Adams & Co. is doing just that to its portfolio, says David Levy, a company principal.

“We have been very proactive in converting freight elevators to passenger elevators, adding to the fixture count in bathrooms and making sure the stairways can handle the higher body count,” he says.

“We are taking the typical bathrooms from one or two stalls and really enlarging them. We are making them ADA-compliant, and making them the nicest standard building bathrooms around.”

Similarly, Grant Greenspan, a principal of the Kaufman Organization, is taking the formerly dilapidated and vacant Ring portfolio of properties and completely reimagining them with entirely new infrastructure, technology and lots of art.

But Greenspan warns, “I think there is resistance beyond the $70-per-foot range for this category.” The technology, advertising, media and Internet tenants were the ones that targeted Midtown South for its cool, prewar industrial feel, brick walls and wood floors — but in the past, they could only afford to spend $30 a foot. “For me, as a potential buyer of other buildings,” Greenspan says, “I am cautious about the pro-formas [and projected rents] as these tech tenants will start going to other neighborhoods.”","All the attention given to buying, selling and rejiggering prewar buildings has driven developers to be more creative with their new purchases. “I don’t believe you can’t make an efficient and prop...",16.7368421053,0.9473684211000001,18.9473684211,medium,high,extractive,architecture

For the investigation into the warehouse fire, I’ve spent the past few days trying to get up to speed on the Oakland Fire Department and the city’s multiple inspection processes.

In the course of reporting, it has become clear that the department faces a number of challenges when it comes to keeping the city safe from fires.

According to several officials who know the department well, Oakland went more than three years without a fire marshal. Records also show that the department remains understaffed, even though the city has budgeted for empty positions to be filled. A city report from October showed that while the Oakland Police Department had only two vacancies, the Fire Department had 63.

Asked about the vacancies, Ms. Deloach Reed said at a news conference that when she took over the department, she realized that the Fire Prevention Bureau “needed better oversight and supervision.” But she did not explain why dozens of jobs remained unfilled.

Ms. Deloach Reed has not agreed to an interview, but we have learned a few things about her tenure. In 2014, she responded to an Alameda County civil grand jury’s investigation of deficiencies in the department’s inspection bureau with an 11-page letter acknowledging that “many of its findings were accurate and that the Fire Department was ‘working diligently’ to correct the problems — including improving its revenue collections and filling jobs that had been frozen or eliminated because of budget cuts,” The San Francisco Chronicle reported.

In 2015, The Mercury News reported, “The Oakland Fire Department for years has filled staffing shortages by spending millions on overtime for existing employees, rather than hiring more firefighters and paramedics” — a situation that union leaders said was dangerous.

Zac Unger, the vice president of Local 55, the Oakland firefighters union, told me the Fire Department was understaffed, with only a handful of inspectors responsible for many buildings. “A comparable city of our size would have two to three times that,” he said.

Ms. Deloach Reed said on Tuesday that eight fire code inspectors were tasked with annually inspecting about 1,800 buildings. She added that firefighters inspected commercial businesses, but that checking seemingly empty warehouses was not part of their duties.

But a search of the database of the city’s Business Tax Office shows that the owner of the Ghost Ship warehouse, Chor Nar Siu Ng, has a business license for the property, and the Oakland fire inspection services website says all “commercial facilities” must be inspected at least once a year. The question now: Does Ms. Ng’s license mean her warehouse should have been inspected regularly?

To try to get a better sense of how the department is run, I spoke with Darryl Von Raesfeld, the former chief of the San Jose Fire Department, who worked closely with Ms. Deloach Reed for 25 years, including when she was assistant fire chief there. Mr. Raesfeld described Ms. Deloach Reed as “very professional.” But he also said that during his tenure, he made sure his department was properly staffed.

I also put a call in to the State Fire Marshal’s office in the hopes of understanding California’s regulations for inspections of warehouses, to get a sense of how often the Ghost Ship should have been inspected.

Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the state mandated fire inspections for only four types of structures: public and private schools, high-rise buildings, residential buildings (like hotels, apartment homes and dormitories), and jails and other detention centers. He said different jurisdictions might have requirements for places like warehouses, but those rules do not come from the state.

An Oakland councilwoman, Rebecca Kaplan, said fire inspection assignments were not doled out by street. “They are assigned hither and yon in no particular order down the street,” she said.

A warehouse owner and a longtime warehouse resident told me that inspections often happened only because owners requested them or because of complaints. It appears, from what we know now, that the Oakland Planning and Building Department had not had an inspector inside the Ghost Ship in the past 30 years.

There is a database kept by the city’s Fire Prevention Bureau that is supposed to be used to make sure each building is regularly inspected. But Ms. Deloach Reed indicated Tuesday that the Ghost Ship was not in that database.

A former Oakland fire inspector who spoke on the condition of anonymity told me that the Ghost Ship would not be the first building not to show up in the database.

Another angle that remains unclear is the relationship between the Oakland Planning and Building Department code inspectors and the fire inspectors. From my understanding, city code inspectors often focus on structures that are under construction and on keeping places free of blight, while fire code inspectors focus on prevention by enforcing requirements for sprinklers and fire alarms. In other cities, like San Jose, the two work closely together. Is that the case in Oakland?

Asa Dodsworth, 36, a member of an art collective, was supposed to be at the Ghost Ship party that night, but he arrived when the warehouse was already in flames. Mr. Dodsworth said he was racked with guilt because his collective had thrown two parties at the Ghost Ship in the past year and a half. He said he had been so worried about the building being at risk that he offered in early 2015 to buy Derick Ion Almena, the master tenant, fire extinguishers.

But Mr. Almena rebuffed the offer, according to Mr. Dodsworth. Mr. Almena has not returned requests for comment.

Ms. Deloach Reed has said there were at least two fire extinguishers in the Ghost Ship.

WHAT’S NEXT? I’d like to talk to any former or current inspectors who work either in the Oakland Planning and Building Department or for the Oakland Fire Department’s Fire Prevention Bureau. And I’m eager to interview any current or former firefighters who know how the department works.

I would also like to talk to any people who were at the party at the Ghost Ship, and to any firefighters who fought the fire.

The back streets of Fruitvale are stacked with piles of soggy garbage, the ever-present reminders of a trash-dumping epidemic that city officials have failed to tackle. Next to vacant lots and car body repair shops live women like Paula Gaines, who sleeps in a trailer without any car to pull it, with a single green candle as her only source of light. Ms. Gaines had a stroke a year ago, leaving her right hand unusable and twisted back at the wrist, and the fingers of her left hand swollen to twice their normal size.

These were my first encounters during a walking tour of Fruitvale, a neighborhood now well known for being the site of the Ghost Ship fire. But two weeks ago, before the fire, residents here might have told you that the biggest problems were robberies, car break-ins, homelessness, trash dumping, near-nightly shootings and prostitution on International Boulevard.

To understand the context of the fire, I reached out to Jose Ortiz, a longtime resident of Fruitvale who spends part of every weekend picking up trash and dead dogs. He would frequently pick up garbage in front of the Ghost Ship warehouse, he said.

Mr. Ortiz spent two decades working as a community liaison officer for the Police and Fire Departments and exudes a passion for the place, but he is wary, too. “The houses are falling down, the fences are collapsing,” he said. “The residents are afraid to go to City Hall for permits because they know it will be a nightmare.”

Mistrust of authority was a recurring theme. Mr. Ortiz said several times that Oakland City Hall was incredibly difficult. “People don’t trust the inspectors, and they don’t trust the city,” he said. “They do things behind their back because they know that dealing with the city is a nightmare.”

As we were walking, Mr. Ortiz’s phone rang. It was a former mayor of Oakland, Elihu Harris. Mr. Ortiz handed me the phone.

“The fire was a symptom, not a disease,” Mr. Harris said. “I’m glad people are paying attention to it, but we need to go back to the core problems.” He mentioned crime and the housing crisis.

Walking on International Boulevard, Mr. Ortiz pointed to a restaurant where he said Guatemalan immigrants worked and slept in primitive conditions. He said he had called city inspectors but gotten no results.

When we arrived at the site of the Ghost Ship, federal investigators were on the scene. Noel Gallo, the Oakland councilman representing Fruitvale, was standing on the sidewalk.

Mr. Gallo was born and raised in Fruitvale and still lives in the neighborhood.

“Oakland’s challenge is enforcement,” he said. “We don’t need more laws.”

He enumerated problems, pointing down Fruitvale Avenue, where homeless seniors live in their cars. Fruitvale is largely Latino, including newly arrived immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, he said. They get paid in cash, making them a target for robberies, Mr. Gallo said.

As we were talking, an elderly man, Alberto Huizar, approached us.

“Hey! Cómo está, señor?” Mr. Gallo greeted him.

Mr. Gallo explained that he had met Mr. Huizar a month ago to discuss a robbery.

“It was a nice, sunny afternoon,” Mr. Gallo said. “Two men robbed him at gunpoint.”

Mr. Huizar had been headed out to celebrate his 78th birthday with his wife. He was walking down the steps of his house to his car when the two men approached, demanded his wallet and struck him on the head with a handgun.

No arrests have been made. And after their initial inquiries, the police have not followed up, Mr. Huizar said.

“They said they would come back, but they never did,” he said.","The Oakland fire chief said the Ghost Ship warehouse did not appear to have been inspected, and a community activist said the Fruitvale neighborhood’s problems ran deep.",65.2666666667,0.8666666667,1.8,high,medium,mixed,architecture

But here is something you may not know: Visiting their boutiques brings with it an extraordinary reward even if you cannot afford the dizzying prices of the merchandise. They provide, free of charge, a chance to experience some of the most spectacular buildings in the world.

In the last few years, many of architecture’s stars, including Renzo Piano, Rem Koolhaas, Toyo Ito and Tadao Ando, have been hired to design shops for luxury brands and have turned the city into a battleground for a rare, and spectacular, game of architectural one–upmanship. They have followed one award winner with another, one splashy statement with a splashier one. While Japanese architecture is known for its cool minimalism, these architects have thrown that out the window, creating sculptural symbols that are difficult to forget.

“The Japanese consumer has an insatiable appetite for the ‘new,’” said Naomi Pollock, Tokyo correspondent for Architectural Record and author of “Made in Japan: 100 New Products” (Merrell). “As a result, fashion brands hire architects to create novel, eye-popping boutiques that will lure shoppers.”

The best neighborhood for this type of “architectural shopping,” as I like to call it, is Omotesando, a leafy zone west of the city center, just outside the blurred neon craziness of Shibuya. Focused along its main spine, Omotesando (sometimes called the Champs-Élysées of Tokyo), it has long been a home to fashion boutiques and fine architecture.

The level of boutiques and architecture was elevated about a decade ago, when the Pritzker Prize-winning Swiss firm Herzog and De Meuron designed a breathtaking store for Prada on the narrower, more hushed, eastern end of Omotesando.

Prada’s facade is made up of large, diamond-shaped green glass pieces. The glazing is warped, creating fun house reflections and furtive peeks inside. From within the building, all that glass creates panoramic views of the neighborhood, framed by a diagonal patchwork quilt. The store’s interior design matches the exterior’s energy, with sleek, curving walls, sculptural built-in shelves and odd touches like mammoth suitcases and TV screens that seem to be growing out of gigantic extension cords. The building is slightly set back from the street and is built into a courtyard, surrounded by a folded wall.

This section of Omotesando has dozens of interesting buildings to gawk at. Just across the street the New York architect Stephan Jaklitsch designed a boutique for Marc Jacobs with a facade covered, in various sections, with smooth glass, etched black stone tiles and perforated steel. Around the corner a fractured, leaning structure contains several boutiques, including Chloé and Cartier. Bathing Ape’s store, around the next bend, is an exposed concrete frame covered by a glass cube; shoes fill up the entire second-floor facade. A space-age storefront by the British firm Future Systems for Comme des Garçons has warped glass walls and some of the funkiest merchandise on the street.

Once you head west, to the wider section of Omotesando, the thoroughfare becomes much busier, the sidewalks more crowded with swiftly moving masses. The first stop is arguably the best of them all — the Japanese master Toyo Ito’s Tod’s Shoes. In 2013, Mr. Ito won the Pritzker Prize, the profession’s highest honor. His store’s fractured, matte concrete and glass structure is inspired by the web of tree branches that line the street. Inside, the motif continues, with diamond-shaped walls that lean and list in varied directions. The interior feels very modern, but still warm and comforting.

You may not want to get too comfortable. The prices at this store — as at many others — hover between obscene and ridiculous. If you’re not in the market to shop, comparing the prices can be fun. The first item I examined, a brown leather briefcase, cost 136,500 yen, or about $1,130 at 116 yen to the dollar. The next, a pair of pillowing purple leather shoes, cost 60,000 yen. And those, it turned out, were the cheap ones.

Next door to Tod’s is a new building for Hugo Boss by the Japanese architect Norihiko Dan that resembles the turret of a castle, twisted and thinned into a listing chute. Covered with thin lines of grooved concrete, it appears to dance with Tod’s, like Frank Gehry’s Fred and Ginger building in Prague. Head west a couple of blocks and you will run into the Coach store, the work of another Pritzker winner, Rem Koolhaas. Here he has created a frontage of frosted and clear glass blocks that looks like a fancy white Rubik’s cube. Vitrines inside repeat this pattern, although less effectively. Head just a few more blocks west and you arrive at Christian Dior, designed by yet another Pritzker laureate, the Japanese firm Sanaa. The architects have created a tall, narrow light box: Windows are covered by translucent screens that ripple like curtains, so only colorful neon peeks through. Unfortunately the store has bulky, formal walls inside, so the look doesn’t carry through.

While you’re gawking at all these buildings, be sure to take in the shopping-unrelated surroundings. Meander behind these temples of fashion and you can explore winding alleys of strange and wonderful buildings, on a much smaller scale. Impossibly thick groupings of electrical wires, micro-thin streets and strangely stacked homes exist side by side with gargantuan edifices and broad boulevards. The best place to take it all in is the roof of the Gyre Center, a dark, angular complex designed by yet another famous firm, the Dutch architects MVRDV, right next to Christian Dior. Look over the balcony at the bustling, tree-lined street, and you also take in the scope of the seemingly infinite, super-dense skyline beyond.

Just down the street, the Japanese star Jun Aoki has designed a boutique for Louis Vuitton (one of a whopping 13 Louis Vuitton locations in Tokyo) whose facade’s varying squares of metal mesh are loosely patterned on stacked suitcases. Inside, the store is full of more art than many of the city’s galleries, including origamilike chandeliers and feather-light hanging steel filaments. The rooms are stacked unevenly, giving you the impression that you’re floating as you walk around.

Once you’ve had your fill of Omotesando, head about 15 minutes east on the subway into Tokyo’s version of Fifth Avenue: the Ginza neighborhood. Ginza is one of several tall neon canyons in the city, but more upscale than, for instance, Shinjuku, the area made famous by the movie “Lost in Translation.”

Here another world-famous architect, Renzo Piano, has built a narrow tower for Hermès, clad in nine stories of silky, bourbon-colored glass blocks. I don’t usually love this material, but in this case it’s a surprisingly striking solution. Look up and you become entranced; it seems as if you could walk right up the side. In the interior, the translucent blocks lend the display spaces a warm glow and create a show when lights mysteriously change color and form behind. The effect is particularly strong on the top floor gallery, with its extra tall floor-to-ceiling glass. Again if you want to go shopping it will cost you. A leather iPad case, for instance, goes for $554, more than most iPads.

A few blocks down the street are two more eye-catching stores. Jun Mitsui’s tower for the jewelry company De Beers has a gray steel facade that warps in and out in broad curves. It’s as if you are looking at a modern office building while very drunk, as more than one onlooker said to me. The interior is like any other store from the chain, but it’s still fun to look at diamonds worth over $100,000 now and then.

Down the block Mr. Ito has designed another jewelry boutique, Mikimoto, a stunning paper-thin white tower cut with large amoeba-shaped windows. I call it the Swiss cheese building, for obvious reasons. The displays inside match this exuberance, with bubble-glass chandeliers, sparkling filaments and crystals, and bright blue and white walls. The third floor has a sleek cafe, and if you’re getting married (or want to pretend to), take a turn at the bridal area for high-class fantasizing.

It’s fun to browse more of the amped-up architecture in this area, including the spectacular LED light shows of Chanel, Max Mara and Matsuya, as well as the etched metal facade of (two more) Louis Vuitton boutiques. And, as they say in retail, there’s so much more.

Not every new boutique is a triumph. Many resemble the cookie-cutter locations you see in retail districts around the world. Even masters like Tadao Ando have their clunkers. His new Omotesando Hills mall shows off his stunning exposed concrete walls, so smooth you feel as if you could eat off them. But in the end it still feels like a mall. Many local architects complain that these high-end follies are not serious architecture, but gimmicky flash. In many cases they are right. But that’s O.K. Form, as any architect will learn, follows function. In this case it’s selling a name and a mystique.

Adherents of the strict rationalism of Modernist design, Mr. Gwathmey and his partner, Robert Siegel, had still managed to infuse their clean lines and grand geometries with warmth and humanity in more than 400 projects spanning four decades, including the expansion of the Guggenheim Museum and a new building for the United States Mission to the United Nations.

For Mr. Siegel, it was almost as if he had lost a part of himself.

“For 42 years, we sat across the desk from each other, we sketched, we drew, we talked, we argued, we worked,” Mr. Siegel said last week inside his Battery Park City apartment. “It became difficult to pretend you’re just going to continue on as it was before.”

Anyone looking at 70 Columbus, a 50-story apartment tower that opened here in November, might think Mr. Gwathmey was still seated across from his old partner, swapping ideas for the building’s unconventional trapezoidal layouts and its 545 apartments, the cascading courtyard, its doorknobs and countertops. It is a continuation of what came before, but also a coda to the Gwathmey-Siegel legacy, one Mr. Siegel has had to maintain alone.

That legacy stretches back to Le Corbusier and Marcel Breuer, designers who helped shape the modern era. During the late 1960s and early ’70s, when architects began to reject simple, form-follows-function boxes in favor of decorative ornaments once again, Mr. Gwathmey was among a group of architects known as The New York Five who found new ways to keep this design language alive and new. The buildings of Mr. Gwathmey and Mr. Siegel, like any that call attention to themselves, have attracted critics and controversy (a luxury tower at Astor Place, for example, proved anathema to many who lamented the demise of the East Village as they knew it). But the architects’ proponents were also legion.

“They knew how to create modern environments that were humanistic, not stark,” said Kenneth Frampton, a scholar of modern architecture at Columbia University.

With rents from $2,300 to $7,000 a month, apartments at 70 Columbus might not seem affordable, but by the standards of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, they are a deal. The firm’s first commission was an apartment for the actress Faye Dunaway in 1969, and in the years since, projects have included palatial spreads in Manhattan towers and Hamptons compounds for Steven Spielberg, Jerry Seinfeld and Steven A. Cohen, a hedge fund manager (a penthouse in the Bloomberg Building once on the market for $115 million).

Mr. Siegel, who is retired, believes one of the reasons the firm was so successful was because it never focused on a particular type of building or project. “Specializing was the death of being alive and being creative,” Mr. Siegel said.

It also helped the firm extend its idealistic modernism to places that might not otherwise have sought it: libraries in Akron, Ohio, and Fort Wayne, Ind.; museums in North Miami and Astoria, Queens, and several projects on college campuses. And a hotel in Hoboken.

After persuading the W Hotel chain to open an outpost across the Hudson River, the project’s developer had to find an architect suitable to the boutique chain’s downtown New York aesthetic. After interviewing numerous Manhattan and international firms, the firm, Ironstate Development, chose Gwathmey Siegel.

“Their attention to detail is just remarkable,” David Barry, a third-generation Hoboken developer and president at Ironstate, said during a recent tour of 70 Columbus. “They know how to solve any problem, whether it’s with the planning board, how to put the units together, what finishes work where.” The firm’s light and airy design was a major factor in getting Hoboken officials to lift a 13-story height restriction, allowing for a 26-story tower and a red neon “W” that shines across the river.

Though Mr. Gwathmey succumbed to esophageal cancer at 71 while the tower was still under construction, Mr. Barry felt compelled to bring the firm on board for Ironstate’s next project, the apartment complex in Jersey City, which began in 2011. “We had a complicated site, at a crucial intersection in the city, and we knew they could make the most of it,” Mr. Barry said. “Besides, we just wanted the experience of working with them again.”

It was an important project for Mr. Siegel as well, and not just in terms of his legacy. It was during the depths of the recession, which had hit architecture firms especially hard. He wanted to keep his designers employed, and he came to rely on them to fill Mr. Gwathmey’s roles at his design table. (A partnership was also arranged in 2011 with Gene Kaufman, a Manhattan architect who does a booming business in budget hotels, to help generate additional work.)

Among the dozens of towers that have blossomed along the Hudson opposite Manhattan, 70 Columbus stands out. Even something as simple as the heating and air conditioning units, which typically puncture the facades of less well-considered buildings, are here turned into a design element. The grates encircle the building, adding rhythm to an otherwise highly vertical structure. Window-bay columns project from the building at seemingly unusual angles.

A 15-story hotel on the corner counters all these straight lines, with a curving prow that softens the approach to the tower, as well as a 50-story twin, to be known as 90 Columbus, that is scheduled to begin rising in March and to be completed by 2018.

The work has drawn admirers, with more than 40 percent of the units already spoken for.

“Being a New Jersey guy, it’s nice to see us finally supporting these more modern, upscale buildings,” said Dean Marchetto, a Hoboken-based architect who got his start at Gwathmey Siegel in the 1970s.

As for Mr. Siegel, finishing up this project without his longtime collaborator was a challenge, but perhaps not as difficult as he anticipated. After all those years of passing ideas and scraps of paper back and forth across the table with Mr. Gwathmey, “I think we rubbed off on one another,” he said.

I believe that last year the board of my co-op gave bonuses to the staff and to the building manager, who is under contract, without informing shareholders. I have no doubt that this is lawful, but I would like to know how much money they gave to the staff. Do I have the right to review the books to find this information?

The New York City tradition of tipping building staff is often a fraught gesture of the holiday season. While residents anxiously stuff envelopes for the doorman, the night porter and nearly everyone else, co-op and condominium boards do the same. Building employees have come to expect (and rely on) this end-of-year windfall. “This is a substantial portion of their yearly income,” said Eric D. Sherman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.

Boards use various methods to decide how to divvy up bonuses, and they do not have to enlighten shareholders about their methodology. Shareholders do, however, have a right to inspect the books and records of the building, and staff bonuses would fall into this category, Mr. Sherman said. Some co-ops also allow shareholders to read board meeting minutes and review the corporation’s financial records.

You could start by sending an informal email to the board president, asking for the information. It is certainly the appropriate time of year to be curious about such things (although even in the dog days of August you would have a right to inquire).

If the president rebuffs your request, send the board a written letter demanding the information, pointing out that it is part of the corporation’s books and records. Explain why you want to know. Specify a date and time, during business hours, that you would like to examine the records at the office of the managing agent. If, for some reason, the board refuses your request, you could file a lawsuit compelling the board to act. But your request is fairly innocuous, so with any luck the board will comply.

If you plan to base the size of your own tips on the information you find, keep in mind that buildings do not give bonuses so residents can duck out of holiday giving. You should base your tip on the quality of service you have received (or hope to receive next year), not on the bonus that staff members received from the co-op board.

I live with my family in a rental apartment, and our landlord relies on a handyman who is sometimes slow to make repairs. When our only toilet broke recently, the handyman was not able to come for two days. How can a tenant be expected to go without a toilet for two days? I’m at my wit’s end.

It should go without saying that your New Jersey landlord needs to provide you with at least one functioning toilet at all times. If it breaks, the landlord should fix it immediately, and by any means necessary. Otherwise, he could be violating the warranty of habitability, which requires apartments to be maintained in safe, sanitary and decent conditions, said Stacey R. Patterson, a New Jersey real estate lawyer. An apartment without a working toilet would not qualify as sanitary living conditions.

But here is where the law has some gray areas, even when it comes to toilets: Let’s say you had two bathrooms, and one toilet was still working. In that scenario, your apartment would not necessarily be considered uninhabitable, so the landlord might be able to respond with a little less urgency to the situation. “The level of seriousness will dictate how much time is considered reasonable for a landlord to make the repairs,” Ms. Patterson said.

So what happens when the only toilet is broken and the handyman is nowhere to be found? The law offers you a few remedies. You could simply hire a plumber to repair the toilet and deduct the cost from your rent (remember to include copies of the receipt). As a tenant, you are also allowed to withhold rent until the landlord makes the necessary repairs, a course of action that would not make sense in this situation. Or you could pay for the work and sue the landlord for reimbursement, but that means taking the landlord to Essex County small claims court.

Regardless of which option you choose, you must first inform the landlord of the problem in writing and give him a reasonable time to respond, unless it is an emergency that would prevent you from being able to contact him in writing before making the repair.

A water leak from one of the apartments in our co-op caused about $30,000 in damage to three other units. The shareholder did not have liability insurance, as required by the terms of the proprietary lease, nor is he responding to demands for payment of damages — another requirement. Does our board have an obligation to take legal action for these violations or is it up to the individual shareholders to bring their own actions?

Individual residents cannot sue a neighbor for lease violations. Only the co-op, which acts as a landlord, can do that. The residents who have sustained damages could file a claim with their homeowners insurance policies. In turn, their insurers could sue the offending neighbor to get reimbursed, said Kevin L. Smith, a Manhattan real estate lawyer who specializes in insurance coverage. (If residents are reluctant to file insurance claims, they could sue the neighbor for damages.)

The offending shareholder is in default of his proprietary lease for failing to maintain his liability insurance. The board should send him a default notice. If he fails to get the proper insurance, the board could seek to terminate his proprietary lease and begin eviction proceedings against him, or seek a court order requiring him to get the insurance.

The board should also put the building’s insurance carrier on notice. The co-op might ultimately be responsible for repairing portions of the damaged apartments, if any common elements were harmed. In that case, the co-op (or its insurance carrier if a claim is filed) may end up suing the offending shareholder for any costs incurred because he had no insurance coverage.",Questions about holiday tipping; slow repairs in a rental; and a costly leak originating from an apartment upstairs.,57.8571428571,0.7619047619,1.1428571429,high,low,abstractive,architecture
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/arts/design/becoming-modern-the-mets-mission-at-the-breuer-building.html,https://web.archive.org/web/2015112819id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/arts/design/becoming-modern-the-mets-mission-at-the-breuer-building.html,Becoming Modern: The Met’s Mission at the Breuer Building,1970-01-01 00:33:35.112819,"It is probably revealing that Sheena Wagstaff, who was brought to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to ramp up its presence in contemporary art, is about to make her debut at the museum’s new Breuer building with an exhibition of an artist who has been dead for more than 20 years. Nasreen Mohamedi is a beloved if little-known modernist who is sometimes called the Indian Agnes Martin, a reference to her penchant for pristine grids.

Ms. Wagstaff, a former chief curator at the Tate Modern, arrived from London four years ago to assume the influential position of chairwoman for the Met’s new department of Modern and contemporary art. On March 18, the museum will unveil the Met Breuer, better known as the former home of the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Met’s annexation of the building prompted an initial burst of skepticism: The Met might seem to have enough to do collecting and clarifying 5,000 years of recorded history, without becoming yet another showplace for the art of the last three minutes.

“I think the exciting thing,” Ms. Wagstaff said, in her dramatically accented British voice, “is that American audiences will get to know that there are these extraordinary things happening in different cities, even in places like Kochi-Muziris, which is in the middle of nowhere.”

Later, when I looked up Kochi-Muziris online, a video popped up that featured Ms. Wagstaff sitting outdoors last year at an art biennial in India’s coastal state of Kerala. She was in a white blouse, her long hair woven into a braid, her outlines crisp against a summery backdrop of green foliage. “It’s a very important biennial,” she announces to the camera with the confidence of a missionary. “If anyone is watching this, you have to get here.”

In seeking to define what the Met will be as a modern art presence in coming years, it seems safe to say it will differ from its famous New York neighbors. It will not be the Whitney (where we fell in love with our first Edward Hoppers and Georgia O’Keeffes). It will not duplicate the Museum of Modern Art (in part because it’s too late to play catch up with MoMA’s peerless holdings of Picasso & Company). It won’t be the ever-expanding Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (still trying to build in Helsinki and Abu Dhabi) or the New Museum (a kunsthalle without much of a collection).

Yet, the Met’s Modern department might turn into the Tate of Fifth Avenue, with all that that implies about the British fascination with post-colonial cultures and a desire to dismantle Western-centric versions of art history.

“My work at the Tate Modern, along with my colleagues, too, was very much about re-addressing the Western canon, re-addressing the idea of what modernism actually means, and broadening and expanding that scope,” said Ms. Wagstaff, a trim, bespectacled woman of 59.

Within Ms. Wagstaff’s own department at the Met, where she oversees a staff of 10 curators, there have been many departures and arrivals. She has dismissed longtime art historians schooled in the art of European Modernism while creating such new positions as a curator of South Asian contemporary art; a curator of Latin American contemporary art; and a curator of contemporary Middle Eastern, North African and Turkish art.

To be sure, we all want to be cognizant of other cultures and sensitive to the differences among us. Yet international biennialism has become a fashion like any other, and you don’t have to be a cultural alarmist to wonder whether American audiences will warm to the Met’s global mission.

“That plays in London; it doesn’t play in America, because America was made in an entirely different way,” said Sean Scully, the Dublin-born American painter who was honored with a major exhibition at the Met in 2006. “It hasn’t colonized two-thirds of the globe, like the British did.”

Ms. Wagstaff’s office is on the mezzanine of the Modern wing of the Met, in an oblong room with blond-wood shelves. The place looks a bit anonymous, perhaps because the walls are bare, and there are no knickknacks or photographs. When I arrived, she was visibly tense. “No one has done a profile of me ever,” she volunteered. Not even during her productive 14 years at the Tate? She shook her head. “They do profiles of the top chaps,” she said.

Asked where one might find some biographical information on her, she joked, “I have a Duane Reade card, so they have some information on me, I am sure.” Then she pulled out two stapled sheets, a “mini-C.V.,” as she called it. It indicated, among other things, that she attended college at the University of East Anglia, in Norwich, England, and traveled to New York in 1982 as a fellow in the Whitney Independent Study Program.

Born in Colchester, England, the daughter of a career army officer, she was raised in Malta and Cyprus. An early job as an assistant to the director of the Oxford Museum of Modern Art landed her in the office of a rising star, Nicholas Serota. In 1998, Mr. Serota was named director of the Tate Britain, and Ms. Wagstaff was hired as head of exhibitions and displays. In 2001, she moved to the other side of the Thames River, to the Tate Modern, which had opened in the defunct Bankside Power Station and become a sensation almost overnight.

Thomas P. Campbell, director of the Met, who is also British, came to his choice of Ms. Wagstaff after bumping into her at various international art fairs. He had begun his career as a scholar of renaissance tapestries and, by his own admission, felt a bit out of his depth when faced with the task of a hire in contemporary art. He was impressed to learn about her work at the Tate Modern, where, he said, “she was very actively engaging with these more international investigations.” She was “looking at stuff in the Middle East and what was going on in Asia.”

Ms. Wagstaff’s husband, Mark Francis, is also in the art world. He served as the founding director of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, and, for most of the ’90s, the couple and their two children resided in the States. Nowadays, the children are grown and live in London, as does Mr. Francis, who is a director of the Gagosian Gallery there. He and Ms. Wagstaff have a fashionably complicated trans-Atlantic marriage. She lives in an apartment on the Upper East Side and gets to London when she can.

When the Met Breuer opens to the public, expect to find, in addition to the Nasreen Mohamedi show, “Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible” — a sprawling, concept-driven, historical extravaganza with 195 objects by 127 artists (at last count) tethered to the question: When is a work of art finished? “To finish a work is to kill it,” Picasso declared, providing more than a small intimation of the non finito aesthetic that became so integral to modern art.

“It’s 550 years’ worth of art,” Ms. Wagstaff said, describing the show. “And that extends from Van Eyck and Titian up until — the most recent work is a work by Urs Fischer from this year.”

Urs Fischer? It was impossible to ignore the fact that the Swiss-born sculptor is represented by the Gagosian Gallery, where Ms. Wagstaff’s husband works.

Museums, in principle, are scholarly institutions removed from the seductions of the marketplace, and Ms. Wagstaff’s ties to the Gagosian Gallery could make the Met vulnerable to charges of favoritism. When the museum acquires or exhibits the work of an artist represented by Gagosian, the gesture is likely to boost the person’s prestige and value. But those who have worked alongside her emphasize her scrupulousness in observing rules regarding conflict of interest. “She was very careful to draw the line,” recalled Dorothy Lichtenstein, the widow of the pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, whose retrospective was Ms. Wagstaff’s last show at the Tate Modern.

“Sheena said: ‘Let’s not get involved with commercial galleries. Let’s not invite them to the meetings,’” Ms. Lichtenstein said. Ms. Wagstaff, in an email, noted that the Urs Fischer loan “was handled with the artist himself and then negotiated with Sadie Coles, London,” another gallery. “Gagosian was not involved in any way.”

Since arriving at the Met, Ms. Wagstaff has established herself as someone whose taste leans toward conceptual art. Three Met exhibitions listed on her C.V. as “personally curated” were commissions for the museum’s famously scenic Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden. The space is probably the most dramatic site for sculpture in New York, yet Ms. Wagstaff’s commissions do not aspire to be sculptures at all.

Her first commission, in 2013, went to Imran Qureshi, a Pakistani artist based in Lahore. It had the misfortune of opening in the wake of the bombing at the Boston Marathon. When you stepped outdoors, onto the roof, dark-red paint seemed to be spattered everywhere. It was easy to miss the allusions to 16th-century Mughal painting and feel spooked by intimations of spilled blood. The installation, the critic Ken Johnson noted in The New York Times, “isn’t adjusted to the complicated social and cultural context of the United States, which is vastly different from that of the Middle East and Pakistan.”

Last May, Pierre Huyghe, a French conceptual artist who looms large on the European scene, unveiled a piece that was so subtle that some asked where it was even when they were standing in front of it. It involved a fish tank stocked with lampreys as well as an alteration to the terrace’s paving stones: A handful of tiles were removed to expose the soil underneath.

When I confided my reservations to Mr. Campbell, saying the piece was short on visual energy, he replied: “It’s very conceptual. It’s too conceptual for some. But I think it’s great. It’s been fascinating watching the weeds grow up on the rooftop over the last six months.”

In addition to organizing temporary exhibitions, Ms. Wagstaff is charged with the not-small task of enlarging the museum’s patchy collection of 20th-century art. There is also the issue of where to house it. Now that Leonard A. Lauder has promised the Met an extraordinary gift of 81 Cubist masterworks, the museum is rethinking the Lila Acheson Wallace Wing, whose awkwardly jutting spaces have been criticized since they opened in 1987. The British architect David Chipperfield will be designing the replacement, for an estimated cost of at least $600 million. The money has not been entirely secured, but new galleries, Mr. Campbell said, “will be a major incentive to collectors.” In the meantime, the Met’s annexation of the Breuer building is an eight-year agreement. Would Ms. Wagstaff like to see the Met keep the Breuer building beyond 2023? “I don’t know,” she replied. “I mean, I honestly don’t know.”

Adding to the uncertainty is the continuing drama of staff changes. When Ms. Wagstaff started at the Met, there were four accomplished art historians with the title of associate curators. All have since left and were required to sign confidentiality agreements forbidding them from speaking to the news media. The most recent departure, that of veteran curator Marla Prather, occurred quietly last summer. Ms. Prather had been working on an important show of works by African-American artists from the South, a gift to the Met by the Souls Grown Deep Foundation. Ms. Prather will see the show to completion.

Asked about the staff changes, Ms. Wagstaff said: “There are good curators, there are great curators, and a lot of mediocre curators. In order to create a really great program, you need great curators. That’s what I am anticipating the Breuer program will reflect.”

Ms. Wagstaff’s mission probably has not been abetted by her personal manner. She is often described by colleagues as brusque and imperious, and I kept hearing that she fails to return messages, even from art-world biggies. “Her phone doesn’t have outgoing service,” jokes Peter Schjeldahl, the art critic of The New Yorker, adding that he was surprised when he tried to contact Ms. Wagstaff to arrange an initial tête-à-tête and never heard back.

In her defense, the Canadian photographer Jeff Wall, said: “I think Americans tend to find British people kind of aloof. She also probably gets a lot of emails that don’t need an answer.”

Moreover, she does have more than a few shows that need her attention.

Her curator Ian Alteveer, for one, is focused on the art of Kerry James Marshall, a prominent figurative painter from Birmingham, Ala., whose work redresses the absence of black subjects in Western art. The survey arrives at the Met Breuer in about a year, after opening first at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.

Ms. Wagstaff is also looking ahead to May and the next rooftop project. For the honor, she has tapped Cornelia Parker, a widely admired British sculptor known for installations in which shrapnel and other material are suspended in midair, as if caught in the act of exploding.

When news of the choice got out, it inspired sighs among some observers. The Met has yet to give a solo rooftop show to an American woman artist. Barbara Rose, the eminent art historian, sent an email: “You mean there is NO American artist good enough??? Maya Lin and Sarah Sze for openers are so much more interesting. And Ursula von Rydingsvard, etc. etc. etc.”

It was a fair question — and, for that matter, are there no American curators qualified to run the department? I posed that question to Mr. Campbell, the director.

“You tell your American curators to stop being such whiners,” he snapped. “This is a very competitive institution. You succeed by being good.”","Sheena Wagstaff, the Met’s curator of Modern and contemporary art, brings a global vision to the first exhibition at the Met Breuer.",106.73076923080001,0.9230769231,2.4615384615,high,medium,mixed,architecture

Doctors don’t like to talk about death, and they often avoid doing so. Most physicians — including me — never studied palliative care in medical school and were rarely trained in how to communicate with patients. By the time I finished residency in 2002, I had to show competency in running Code Blues, inserting arterial lines and performing lumbar punctures, but not a single senior physician had to certify that I could actually talk with patients.

The recent expansion of the field of palliative medicine, with doctors who are experts on having these discussions, is a giant step in the right direction. But the growth of this specialty has not kept up with the need: There are 4,400 such doctors in the United States today, but the need is estimated to be as high as 18,000 physicians. Incentives such as student loan forgiveness, higher baseline salaries and more robust insurance reimbursements would encourage more students to consider the specialty as a profession. But it would take time for society to reap the benefits.

Recently Medicare announced plans to reimburse doctors for having advance care planning conversations with patients. This is an important start. But it’s not enough to simply reimburse for these discussions, which are not one-time exchanges but rather a process over time. Neither is it realistic to expect most doctors who have never been trained to have these dialogues to all of a sudden be experts, which studies have suggested is difficult. We need to make sure that these exchanges are high-quality, informed, shared decision-making encounters where patients understand each of their options along with the risks and benefits.

And words are not always enough. One innovative solution is the use of short, unbiased videos to convey difficult medical information. In our visually literate society, sometimes videos enhancing and supplementing advance care planning conversations can do a better job of educating patients and their loved ones.

Leveraging video technology to better inform patients and families about their medical options can quickly and cheaply communicate information; it is like Khan Academy, but for health care.

Often, patients and their families are bewildered by the decisions they have to make because they don’t have enough information. A person with a serious illness might think he wants a ventilator to help him breathe or a feeding tube to help him eat, but he may not know what those interventions really entail. Instead of waiting to learn from experience and being well informed only when it’s too late, patients can benefit from watching short videos that prime them to consider questions and options for medical care while they still have a chance to make their own decisions.

These videos can pose questions like: What kinds of things are important to you in your life? If you were not able to do the activities you enjoy, are there any medical treatments that would be too much? What fears do you have about getting sick or receiving medical care? Do you have any beliefs that guide you when you make medical decisions? What should our goals be and what procedures would you or wouldn’t you want attempted?

My interest in using videos stemmed from an experience I had years ago when I was just starting out as a doctor. One of my patients was a professor of poetry who had an aggressive brain tumor, and wanted to be patched up to go on living as long as she could. I supported her wishes but also wanted to ensure that she was making a truly informed decision.

I swaddled her in a blanket and placed her in a wheelchair along with her numerous IVs and heart monitor. We went to the I.C.U. for a tour.

From a distance, she viewed a patient on a ventilator and another on hemodialysis. It was a routine evening. But then, suddenly, the organized chaos of a Code Blue.

We quickly left, but not before she caught a few glimpses of CPR, which looked far more brutal than the pristine gentle images that are often portrayed in the media and where almost every patient survives.

As we made our way back to her room, I apologized. But she told me she appreciated seeing the I.C.U. for herself. “It doesn’t look like that on television. I had no idea…”

It’s not practical to take every patient on a hospital tour. Giving the patient information like that with a video can spark a conversation with the physician and promote patient-centeredness, engagement and empowerment.

My colleagues and I at Massachusetts General Hospital, as well as colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, have created such videos and software programs in various languages. Our studies suggest that when patients use these interventions that supplement conversations with doctors, they are more knowledgeable about their options and better able to get medical care that aligns with their values at the end of life.

With my wife, Aretha Delight Davis, who is both a doctor and a lawyer, I created a nonprofit organization, ACP Decisions, which develops such videos to help guide patients through the health care process. One of the largest implementations of these videos is in Hawaii, where they are available in all hospitals, all hospices, most nursing homes and with over 200 health care providers. This effort has been led by one of the largest nonprofits in the state, the Hawaii Medical Service Association, along with a consortium of insurers, doctors and patient advocacy groups. One of the first hospitals in Hawaii to use our educational tools was Hilo Medical Center. In the first 18 months, the hospital doubled documentation of its sickest patients’ care wishes; having the conversation with providers became the new standard of care.

Unfortunately, most Americans live and die in a health care system that does not offer patients and families the educational tools they need to navigate care at the end of life. If that were true of cancer therapies, there would be an uproar and outrage. How many patients will we allow to die in our health care system without their being fully informed of their options? Expanding the use of videos that are made to give patients information in a neutral, unbiased way will do more to help patients make good decisions than having discussions with unprepared doctors.

As a physician who takes care of patients in the hospital, I don’t always see how things turn out when they leave. But a few weeks after taking the professor on that tour of the I.C.U., I caught sight of her obituary in the local paper. She had died at home, in the company of her friends and family and surrounded by her poetry books, as were her wishes.

It would be just another success story of the digital age, if it were not for the company’s location: Greece, a country that almost defines economic mismanagement, a place long resistant to the demands of global competition and a sinkhole for the aspirations of young people.

Defying the problems their country’s recent history has bequeathed them, a few Greek entrepreneurs are managing to thrive here, providing a glimmer of hope for the economy and their generation even as Greece girds for more budget austerity and wrenching regulatory changes.

While members of Parliament, labor unions and the syndicates that control entry to professions complain that the Greek bailout deal is a humiliating surrender of national sovereignty, a young entrepreneurial class is leapfrogging over what it perceives to be a sclerotic, protected and backward-looking business culture.

Young entrepreneurs here say they have little stake in the political and ideological debate, but are willing to embrace the realities that come with the policies being imposed by Greece’s creditors, including an end to a hodgepodge of regulations, protectionism, tax breaks and special-interest provisions that have long impeded the country’s competitiveness.

“Our customers are not Greek companies, so the success of our project does not depend on Greece at all,” said Stefanos Vasdekis, 35, one of the two founding partners of Travelmyth. “It’s how competitive we will be in a worldwide environment.”

With a youth unemployment rate around 50 percent, Greece presents its young people with a stark choice: emigrate and join a brain drain to Western Europe and beyond, or stay in their homeland and struggle against long odds to find a livelihood. The country’s recession-battered traditional industries have little to offer, so for many young people, the coveted prize has become a government job, obtained through the sponsorship of a political party.

But some are trying to draw instead on the country’s mercantile roots to build businesses of their own, despite all the impediments.

At least a half-dozen small-business incubators and co-working spaces — buildings where entrepreneurs can rent space cheaply and benefit from proximity to one another — have sprung up in Athens, nurturing new companies with up to about 20 employees.

A number of philanthropic organizations have sponsored contests and awarded seed money to young Greek entrepreneurs. Among them is the Hellenic Initiative, a nonprofit that receives support from Greeks abroad.

The Hellenic Initiative held a venture fair in June at which 19 start-up and established Greek companies made presentations to international investors, seeking capital and connections. The hopefuls included a cosmetics safety lab, a maker of custom folding bicycles and an eBay-like website auctioning fuel oil for ships. Investors came to the fair from across Europe, the United States and Australia.

Realistically, Greece’s problems are too big for one still relatively small sector to solve on its own. But, some experts say, it can lead the way.

“There’s a divide between the old school and the new,” said Jeremy Downward, the chief investment officer for Alpheus Advisors, an investment firm. He was also a founding partner in Greece’s first investment bank, Alpha Finance, from 1989 to 2001.

“Of course a lot of these ideas will fall by the wayside,” Mr. Downward said. “But I really believe that there will be a handful of innovative ones that do well. There is no shortage of really smart kids, driven kids, with a lot of zeal, a lot of drive, a lot of hunger and a pretty good business plan.”

One incubator for new Greek businesses was set up by the government of the Netherlands — a noteworthy twist, given that the Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has become a figure of dread in Greece for driving a hard bargain in the debt-crisis negotiations. The Netherlands Embassy, working with local foundations and with Dutch companies like Heineken that have a substantial stake in Greece, created the incubator, known as the Orange Grove, in downtown Athens.

Even at 7 on Friday evening, the place was a hive of activity, as a dozen young men and women worked at laptops or conducted conferences in the industrial-style ground-floor space. They seemed to be ignoring the vending machine stocked with Heineken beer in favor of water and freshly brewed coffee. Stacked on coffee tables were pamphlets and business cards for enterprises like Bloode, which describes itself as an online blood donation service.

Young businesses have been moving lately into old industrial buildings in the Gazi neighborhood. In a co-working space there called Found.ation, five entrepreneurs in their 20s (not including one partner now doing mandatory Army service) operate a youth-oriented marketing network called Hangover Media.

One of their more successful ventures so far is Neolaia.gr, a website featuring entertainment and job listings, and even an anger test. The site is supported by “native advertising” — sponsored articles and features that the Hangover team writes for companies trying to reach a youth market.

Once they get started, the young entrepreneurs face the challenge of scaling their businesses up to a meaningful size that might start employing more than a tiny handful of people.

“Talking about the crisis, and talking about all the negative aspects of this huge economic depression in this country, doesn’t help that much,” said Dimitris G. Kalavros-Gousiou, a co-founder of Found.ation. “It helps if you can start building something that makes sense, and makes sense both for business and for society.”

Though they would welcome a financial helping hand from the government, young entrepreneurs say that they have learned not to expect one. But seed money has started to flow from private sources, and in some cases from European Union programs.

George Tziralis, 33, an engineer, got into the seed-capital business five years ago when he and a partner founded Openfund, which invests in high-tech companies that originate in Greece but are aimed at international markets. The fund has since grown to five partners managing 15 million euros ($16 million).

Among its recent investments are Taxibeat, an Uber-like ride-hailing application that has become popular in Greece, and Workable, an employee recruitment tool now used by more than 2,000 small and medium-sized companies in 39 countries.

“We’ve demonstrated that some pretty good and interesting companies can come out of, let’s say, an exotic start-up location like Greece,” Mr. Tziralis said. “We get the best part of what exists here, without worrying about the worst part.”

One of the best parts is an educated, eager labor force that, because of the hard economic times, is relatively inexpensive to employ. “Greek salaries are much lower than in other European countries, and Greek workers have more loyalty to start-ups,” Mr. Tziralis said.

For Internet entrepreneurs like Mr. Vasdekis of Travelmyth and his partner, John Nousis, also 35, a willingness to embrace change comes naturally. They say Greece can no longer count on prosperity flowing from the country’s old mainstays — shipping, olive oil, cheese and traditional tourism.

The two men started their first company as college freshmen in 1998, and have averaged a new project about every other year since then. Some have succeeded and some have not, but through it all they have made enough to support themselves while reinvesting in their business.

Travelmyth operates almost entirely online; its founders keep an office in an incubator space, but its fluctuating staff of five to 15 employees telecommute. But there remain some bureaucratic trammels that the owners, to their dismay, must face the old-fashioned way.

“I feel sick every time I have to go by the tax office,” Mr. Vasdekis said. “Really, really sick.”

You toggle over to check your phone during even the smallest pause in real life. You feel those phantom vibrations even when no one is texting you. You have trouble concentrating for long periods.

Over the past few years researchers have done a lot of work on attention span, and how the brain is being re-sculpted by all those hours a day spent online. One of the conclusions that some of them are coming to is that the online life nurtures fluid intelligence and offline life is better at nurturing crystallizing intelligence.

Being online is like being a part of the greatest cocktail party ever and it is going on all the time. If you email, text, tweet, Facebook, Instagram or just follow Internet links you have access to an ever-changing universe of social touch-points. It’s like you’re circulating within an infinite throng, with instant access to people you’d almost never meet in real life.

Online life is so delicious because it is socializing with almost no friction. You can share bon mots, photographs, videos or random moments of insight, encouragement, solidarity or good will. You live in a state of perpetual anticipation because the next social encounter is just a second way. You can control your badinage and click yourself away when boredom lurks.

This form of social circulation takes the pressure off. I know some people who are relaxed and their best selves only when online. Since they feel more in control of the communication, they are more communicative, vulnerable and carefree.

This mode of interaction nurtures mental agility. The ease of movement on the web encourages you to skim ahead and get the gist. You do well in social media and interactive gaming when you can engage and then disengage with grace. This fast, frictionless world rewards the quick perception, the instant evaluation and the clever performance. As the neuroscientist Susan Greenfield writes in her book “Mind Change,” expert online gamers have a great capacity for short-term memory, to process multiple objects simultaneously, to switch flexibly between tasks and to quickly process rapidly presented information.

Fluid intelligence is a set of skills that exist in the moment. It’s the ability to perceive situations and navigate to solutions in novel situations, independent of long experience.

Offline learning, at its best, is more like being a member of a book club than a cocktail party. When you’re offline you’re not in constant contact with the universe. There are periods of solitary reading and thinking and then more intentional gatherings to talk and compare.

Research at the University of Oslo and elsewhere suggests that people read a printed page differently than they read off a screen. They are more linear, more intentional, less likely to multitask or browse for keywords.

The slowness of solitary reading or thinking means you are not as concerned with each individual piece of data. You’re more concerned with how different pieces of data fit together. How does this relate to that? You’re concerned with the narrative shape, the synthesizing theory or the overall context. You have time to see how one thing layers onto another, producing mixed emotions, ironies and paradoxes. You have time to lose yourself in another’s complex environment.

As Greenfield puts it, “by observing what happens, by following the linear path of a story, we can convert information into knowledge in a way that emphasizing fast response and constant stimulation cannot. As I see it, the key issue is narrative.”

When people in this slower world gather to try to understand connections and context, they gravitate toward a different set of questions. These questions are less about sensation than about meaning. They argue about how events unfold and how context influences behavior. They are more likely to make moral evaluations. They want to know where it is all headed and what are the ultimate ends.

Crystallized intelligence is the ability to use experience, knowledge and the products of lifelong education that have been stored in long-term memory. It is the ability to make analogies and comparisons about things you have studied before. Crystallized intelligence accumulates over the years and leads ultimately to understanding and wisdom.

The online world is brand new, but it feels more fun, effortless and natural than the offline world of reading and discussion. It nurtures agility, but there is clear evidence by now that it encourages a fast mental rhythm that undermines the ability to explore narrative, and place people, ideas and events in wider contexts.

The playwright Richard Foreman once described people with cathedral-like personalities — with complex, inner density, people with distinctive personalities, and capable of strong permanent attachments. These days that requires an act of rebellion, among friends who assign one another reading and set up times to explore narrative and cultivate crystallized intelligence.",Technology-driven losses in attention span are interfering with our ability to become deep and complex people.,49.8421052632,0.6315789474,0.8421052632,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Fragrance sticks. Incense. Potpourri. Many of us spend a lot of time (and money) trying to make our homes smell pretty. Hotels have been dousing their lobbies with fragrances for years, hoping we’ll keep booking rooms at the Westin because it smells like White Tea.

Now, rental buildings and condominiums in New York City have caught onto the idea, infusing lobbies, hallways and fitness centers with fragrances. Sometimes they are blown in through the ductwork, other times stand-alone machines do the job. Either way, the building smells a whole lot fresher than a city sidewalk.

Take 21 West End, a rental on the Upper West Side. Ever since it opened in September, tenants have been attributing its summery aroma to the floral arrangements. Building staff members are quick to set the record straight: The lobby smells like a beach because of Ocean Mist, a fragrance pumped in through the ductwork. “You really pick your head up and take notice,” said Ken Ludwig, 21 West End’s general manager.

Come November, Ocean Mist will be replaced with Season’s Greetings, which reminded me of hot apple cider and cinnamon when I sampled it. (After I tested both fragrances, my office smelled like Christmas in July.) The building will eventually rotate four fragrances, including White Blossom Tea and Cranberry Apple — the result of a painstaking selection process. “You have no idea how hard it is to smell 1,500 fragrances,” Mr. Ludwig said. “Your nose can become numb to anything.”

Numb noses or not, buildings are rushing to aromatize. ScentAir, the company behind the fragrances for 21 West End and Westin’s White Tea, says multifamily properties have been the largest growing segment of its business for the last three years.

The North Carolina-based company now provides fragrances for 67 residential buildings in the New York area. While some properties, like 21 West End, choose fragrances from an existing catalog, others want something original. Find the perfect scent and a resident — or, more important, a prospective one — could walk through the door, inhale and feel at home.

Dawn Goldworm is the scent director for 12.29, the New York fragrance design company she founded with her twin sister, Samantha. Dawn Goldworm says smell is often an overlooked element of the luxury experience, which is surprising considering our sense of smell is so interwoven with our moods and feelings. “If you walk into a building that has the most beautiful architecture and the most incredible design you’ve ever seen, and it smells like the pollution and the trash outside in New York City, you’re not having a luxury experience,” she said.

Last year, the Goldworm sisters, who have designed fragrances for Lady Gaga and Valentino, created Craft, a signature fragrance for the real estate developer DDG. Now, the lobbies of all DDG properties, including the condos XOCO 325 on West Broadway and 41 Bond, share a sultry aroma. What exactly does Craft smell like? Ask an olfactory expert, it’s like talking to a sommelier about a fine wine: “The scent is very much plain, with the warmth of wood milk,” Dawn Goldworm said. “But also a slightly creamy ambery, textural feeling with all these natural wood notes.”

All this sniffing makes me wonder: What if you don’t like what you inhale? Smell evokes emotions and memories, including those we’d rather forget. If the lobby mural is not to your liking, you can avert your gaze and move along. Not so with a distinct perfume. Like it or not, it will greet you like an eager puppy whenever you walk through the door.

“The whole idea of aromatherapy at one level is wrong,” said Rachel Herz, an adjunct assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University and the author of “The Scent of Desire: Discovering Our Enigmatic Sense of Smell” (Harper Perennial, 2007).

Our culture has collectively decided that lavender makes for a relaxing yoga class, but the flower is not a natural sedative. So, a person might not feel calm in a lavender-infused gym if his first encounter with the fragrance takes him back to elementary school, where the plant bloomed outside as he struggled through long division. Instead, he might cringe and leave.

“It’s not like everyone’s going to have the same experience,” Dr. Herz said. “It has to do with your own past.”

Olfactory experts point to signature fragrances as a solution: Create an original scent and no one will recoil at some troubling memory. But that aroma could become a fragrant monster if a prospective resident’s first encounter with it is a negative one. Perhaps the first time she visited the building was after a particularly trying day at the office. Even if she goes on to rent or buy the apartment, every time she walks in the lobby, she might associate it with her crummy mood, according to Dr. Herz.

Memories aside, some people just don’t like perfume. Fragrances can cause eyes to burn, throats to itch and noses to run, even if allergies are not involved. “It functions like an irritant — it’s overwhelming to the system,” said Beth E. Corn, an associate professor of allergy and immunology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, adding, “Why do you want to expose yourself to this?”

“To me, it means a headache,” said Jonathan J.

Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, 150 years ago next month, effectively ended the Civil War. Preoccupied with the challenges of our own time, Americans will probably devote little attention to the sesquicentennial of Reconstruction, the turbulent era that followed the conflict. This is unfortunate, for if any historical period deserves the label “relevant,” it is Reconstruction.

Issues that agitate American politics today — access to citizenship and voting rights, the relative powers of the national and state governments, the relationship between political and economic democracy, the proper response to terrorism — all of these are Reconstruction questions. But that era has long been misunderstood.

Reconstruction refers to the period, generally dated from 1865 to 1877, during which the nation’s laws and Constitution were rewritten to guarantee the basic rights of the former slaves, and biracial governments came to power throughout the defeated Confederacy. For decades, these years were widely seen as the nadir in the saga of American democracy. According to this view, Radical Republicans in Congress, bent on punishing defeated Confederates, established corrupt Southern governments presided over by carpetbaggers (unscrupulous Northerners who ventured south to reap the spoils of office), scalawags (Southern whites who supported the new regimes) and freed African-Americans, unfit to exercise democratic rights. The heroes of the story were the self-styled Redeemers, who restored white supremacy to the South.

This portrait, which received scholarly expression in the early-20th-century works of William A. Dunning and his students at Columbia University, was popularized by the 1915 film “Birth of A Nation” and by Claude Bowers’s 1929 best-selling history, “The Tragic Era.” It provided an intellectual foundation for the system of segregation and black disenfranchisement that followed Reconstruction. Any effort to restore the rights of Southern blacks, it implied, would lead to a repeat of the alleged horrors of Reconstruction.

HISTORIANS have long since rejected this lurid account, although it retains a stubborn hold on the popular imagination. Today, scholars believe that if the era was “tragic,” it was not because Reconstruction was attempted but because it failed.

Reconstruction actually began in December 1863, when Abraham Lincoln announced a plan to establish governments in the South loyal to the Union. Lincoln granted amnesty to most Confederates so long as they accepted the abolition of slavery, but said nothing about rights for freed blacks. Rather than a blueprint for the postwar South, this was a war measure, an effort to detach whites from the Confederacy. On Reconstruction, as on other questions, Lincoln’s ideas evolved. At the end of his life, he called for limited black suffrage in the postwar South, singling out the “very intelligent” (prewar free blacks) and “those who serve our cause as soldiers” as most worthy.

Lincoln did not live to preside over Reconstruction. That task fell to his successor, Andrew Johnson. Once lionized as a heroic defender of the Constitution against Radical Republicans, Johnson today is viewed by historians as one of the worst presidents to occupy the White House. He was incorrigibly racist, unwilling to listen to criticism and unable to work with Congress. Johnson set up new Southern governments controlled by ex-Confederates. They quickly enacted the Black Codes, laws that severely limited the freed people’s rights and sought, through vagrancy regulations, to force them back to work on the plantations. But these measures aroused bitter protests among blacks, and convinced Northerners that the white South was trying to restore slavery in all but name.

There followed a momentous political clash, the struggle between Johnson and the Republican majority (not just the Radicals) in Congress. Over Johnson’s veto, Congress enacted one of the most important laws in American history, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, still on the books today. It affirmed the citizenship of everyone born in the United States, regardless of race (except Indians, still considered members of tribal sovereignties). This principle, birthright citizenship, is increasingly rare in today’s world and deeply contested in our own contemporary politics, because it applies to the American-born children of undocumented immigrants.

The act went on to mandate that all citizens enjoy basic civil rights in the same manner “enjoyed by white persons.” Johnson’s veto message denounced the law for what today is called reverse discrimination: “The distinction of race and color is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored and against the white race.” Indeed, in the idea that expanding the rights of nonwhites somehow punishes the white majority, the ghost of Andrew Johnson still haunts our discussions of race.

Soon after, Congress incorporated birthright citizenship and legal equality into the Constitution via the 14th Amendment. In recent decades, the courts have used this amendment to expand the legal rights of numerous groups — most recently, gay men and women. As the Republican editor George William Curtis wrote, the 14th Amendment changed a Constitution “for white men” to one “for mankind.” It also marked a significant change in the federal balance of power, empowering the national government to protect the rights of citizens against violations by the states.

In 1867 Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts, again over Johnson’s veto. These set in motion the establishment of new governments in the South, empowered Southern black men to vote and temporarily barred several thousand leading Confederates from the ballot. Soon after, the 15th Amendment extended black male suffrage to the entire nation.

The Reconstruction Acts inaugurated the period of Radical Reconstruction, when a politically mobilized black community, with its white allies, brought the Republican Party to power throughout the South. For the first time, African-Americans voted in large numbers and held public office at every level of government. It was a remarkable, unprecedented effort to build an interracial democracy on the ashes of slavery.

Most offices remained in the hands of white Republicans. But the advent of African-Americans in positions of political power aroused bitter hostility from Reconstruction’s opponents. They spread another myth — that the new officials were propertyless, illiterate and incompetent. As late as 1947, the Southern historian E. Merton Coulter wrote that of the various aspects of Reconstruction, black officeholding was “longest to be remembered, shuddered at, and execrated.”

There was corruption in the postwar South, although given the scandals of New York’s Tweed Ring and President Ulysses S. Grant’s administration, black suffrage could hardly be blamed. In fact, the new governments had a solid record of accomplishment. They established the South’s first state-funded public school systems, sought to strengthen the bargaining power of plantation laborers, made taxation more equitable and outlawed racial discrimination in transportation and public accommodations. They offered aid to railroads and other enterprises in the hope of creating a New South whose economic expansion would benefit black and white alike.

Reconstruction also made possible the consolidation of black families, so often divided by sale during slavery, and the establishment of the independent black church as the core institution of the emerging black community. But the failure to respond to the former slaves’ desire for land left most with no choice but to work for their former owners.

It was not economic dependency, however, but widespread violence, coupled with a Northern retreat from the ideal of equality, that doomed Reconstruction. The Ku Klux Klan and kindred groups began a campaign of murder, assault and arson that can only be described as homegrown American terrorism. Meanwhile, as the Northern Republican Party became more conservative, Reconstruction came to be seen as a misguided attempt to uplift the lower classes of society.

One by one, the Reconstruction governments fell. As a result of a bargain after the disputed presidential election of 1876, the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes assumed the Oval Office and disavowed further national efforts to enforce the rights of black citizens, while white Democrats controlled the South.

By the turn of the century, with the acquiescence of the Supreme Court, a comprehensive system of racial, political and economic inequality, summarized in the phrase Jim Crow, had come into being across the South. At the same time, the supposed horrors of Reconstruction were invoked as far away as South Africa and Australia to demonstrate the necessity of excluding nonwhite peoples from political rights. This is why W.E.B. Du Bois, in his great 1935 work “Black Reconstruction in America,” saw the end of Reconstruction as a tragedy for democracy, not just in the United States but around the globe.

While violated with impunity, however, the 14th and 15th Amendments remained on the books. Decades later they would provide the legal basis for the civil rights revolution, sometimes called the Second Reconstruction.

Citizenship, rights, democracy — as long as these remain contested, so will the necessity of an accurate understanding of Reconstruction. More than most historical subjects, how we think about this era truly matters, for it forces us to think about what kind of society we wish America to be.

But when the critic Paul Goldberger coined this term in 1979 — in a nod to Jordan L. Gruzen and his father, Barnett Sumner Gruzen — it seemed entirely fitting.

Gruzen & Partners was so “successful in obtaining commissions in the civic center area,” Mr. Goldberger wrote in “The City Observed: New York,” that the blocks around the Municipal Building “seem at first glance to consist entirely of structures of its design.”

These include 1 Police Plaza, a monumental, red-brick, waffle-iron of a building, and a striking departure from typical government architecture when it was completed in 1973; the boldly sculptural Chatham Terrace towers of 1965, where the play of light and shadow on concrete recalls the work of Le Corbusier; and the sinuous Chatham Green of 1961, a slender slab of apartments in the form of a shallow S.

Jordan Gruzen’s death from cancer on Jan. 27, at 80, not only ended a father-and-son practice dating to the 1930s, but also ruptured one of the longest-running architectural partnerships in the city, with Peter Samton. The two met in 1952 as freshmen at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when Mr. Samton jumped into a pool and landed right on Mr. Gruzen. (At least, that is how Mr. Gruzen told it.)

They last saw each other on Jan. 23, when Mr. Gruzen invited Mr. Samton to inspect the house he was building in Amagansett, N.Y. The structure is framed out now, but a lot of work lies ahead on the interiors — work that Mr. Gruzen must have known he would not live to see completed.

That poignant certainty was unmentioned as Mr. Gruzen showed off the beautiful views and shared a few observations with the builders. “We never spoke about it,” Mr. Samton said. “He saw it as a house he would have loved to live in. He envisioned his family living there.”

“Jordan died very much as he lived,” Mr. Samton added. “The ultimate optimist.”

Mr. Gruzen was not even greatly daunted when the firm’s office at 90 West Street was destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, though he said he wished he had taken a Le Corbusier drawing with him when he fled that day.

He is survived by his wife, Lee; a son, Alex; two daughters, Rachel and Georgia; his former wife, Joan Gruzen; a brother, Maxson; and four grandchildren.

It was not just on his own house that Mr. Gruzen lavished great care. Tony Bechara, the chairman of El Museo del Barrio, on Fifth Avenue, between 104th and 105th Streets, recalled how Mr. Gruzen involved himself as he and William Singer worked on a renovation completed five years ago.

“He would come to theater performances, small openings, little community gatherings,” Mr. Bechara said. “All of a sudden I’d look up, and Jordan would be there. He really wanted to get into the life rhythm of the building.”

There was a formal iron gate at the entrance to the museum that dated to the building’s days as an orphanage. Mr. Bechara greatly admired it. But Mr. Gruzen argued that it ought to be eliminated to open the forecourt to the street and, by extension, to Central Park. He said the fence no longer served the purpose of separating orphan children from passers-by. “He convinced me on the spot,” Mr. Bechara said.

You are forgiven if you haven’t heard of Kelly & Gruzen and its successors: Gruzen & Partners, Gruzen Samton Steinglass, Gruzen Samton and IBI Group-Gruzen Samton, the current incarnation.

Apart from the buildings of Gruzen Country, the octagonal twin towers of Arthur A. Schomburg Plaza in East Harlem, and one-offs like the banjo-shaped George W. Wingate High School in Brooklyn, the Gruzen firms were not known for foreground architecture, the kind that attracts critical attention and glossy publications. They did not depend on that to win commissions. Rather, they cultivated governmental, educational and institutional clients that could provide decades’ worth of work.

The rainmaker role suited Mr. Gruzen. “Jordan loved to go out at night, to one event or the other,” Mr. Samton said. “He learned from his father.”

No matter how long he lived in New York, Mr. Gruzen never forgot that his roots were across the river.

It was in Jersey City, 80 years ago, that Barnett Gruzen, known as Barney, entered into a partnership with Col. Hugh A. Kelly, a well-connected architect and engineer.

That was why the Port Imperial Intermodal Ferry Terminal in Weehawken, N.J., was such an important project for Jordan Gruzen. “It was the connecting fabric,” Mr. Samton said, “between New Jersey and New York.”

There was another connection. Mr. Gruzen could see New Jersey from his apartment in the Regatta, overlooking the South Cove at Battery Park City. His firm had designed the building. And it was where he died last week.

Barricaded by a Rising Condo

A luxury condominium is under construction across from the rental building where I live. A fire station is also across the street from the construction site. A temporary structure has been erected in front of my building to accommodate fire trucks during the years-long construction period. The structure is a great inconvenience for the residents of our building. Taxis, cars and moving trucks can no longer pull up to the front of the building, and the residents are greeted with an enormous and ugly brown structure the moment we set foot outside. Traffic is diverted to a small lane next to this structure, creating unsafe conditions for drivers and pedestrians. What can be done about this?

From dangling cranes to deafening pile-driving to penthouses precariously cantilevered over tenements, the construction boom has spared few New Yorkers. In some neighborhoods, it is hard to walk more than a few blocks without traversing a telltale sidewalk bridge. In your case, just stepping outside brings the issue into sharp relief.

Your question, however, is more political than practical. You could contact the Department of Transportation, as that agency would oversee a structure that affects traffic, but that might not get you very far. To get a full answer, you might have better luck reaching out to your local community board or elected officials. If they do not already know about the structure, they could (and should) investigate. They could contact the local firehouse and the various city agencies involved to see if this temporary structure was the best decision. By calling, you would add your name to a list of residents who might have also aired grievances.

It is likely that the condo is an as-of-right development, which means that it was not subject to a public review process where the community would have had the opportunity to weigh in on practical matters like where to house fire trucks. This might explain why the structure seemingly rose out of thin air. “This happens all the time throughout the city, but when it’s as of right, everyone is taken by surprise and that’s the worst,” said Helen Rosenthal, a member of the New York City Council whose district includes the Upper West Side. “A little information goes a long way.”

Can a landlord retaliate against a market-rent tenant or a rent-stabilized tenant for joining a tenants association in a mainly rent-stabilized building? The possible retaliation would be to raise the rent drastically or not renew the lease for the market-rate tenant, or to fail to retain a preferential rent in the case of the rent-stabilized tenant who currently benefits from one.

Market-rate tenants have few protections. A landlord can decide not to renew a lease on a whim, or raise the rent when the lease comes up for renewal. Tenants often worry that complaining too loudly (or frequently) could spell a rent increase at the end of the lease term. But state law protects market-rate tenants from retaliatory eviction for some behavior, like joining a tenants group.

How would the law protect you if you joined a tenants association? If the landlord does not offer you a new lease when your current one expires, for example, you could use your membership as evidence in court to show that his actions are retaliatory. If you joined the association within six months of the proceeding, “the landlord must then provide a credible reason for his act,” said Jeffrey R. Metz, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. He would have to show that he wanted the tenant out for a reason other than to retaliate.

Although the law is silent about rent increases, if your rent rises drastically, you could still make the same argument under the same statute. If your case prevailed, the landlord would have to offer you a new one-year lease. If you are worried that your landlord might retaliate, hold onto any tenants association minutes that show your membership and any letters you might have written to the landlord on behalf of the association.

Stabilized tenants might have a harder time proving retaliation if a landlord stops giving them preferential rent, which is a rent that is below the maximum amount legally allowed for a unit. “The owner could simply argue that given prevailing market conditions, it could charge and get the higher legal regulated rent,” Mr. Metz said.

My mother-in-law, who lived in a limited-equity co-op for more than 30 years, died recently. My brother-in-law’s name was added to the proprietary lease about a year before her death, although he never really lived in the apartment as an adult. He is also the executor of the estate. What are the succession rights of the apartment, and can he legally sell the rights back to the co-op?

If your brother-in-law’s name is on the proprietary lease, it is likely his name is also on the stock certificate. If that is the case, then there is no succession issue: Your brother-in-law is already a shareholder. But there is a bigger issue here. If your brother-in-law does not live in the apartment, the co-op board could seek to evict him. Much like rent-stabilized apartments, limited-equity co-ops require shareholders to keep their apartment as their primary residence.

If the co-op sued for eviction and your brother-in-law could not prove that he has been living there, he would have to relinquish his shares back to the co-op. Since these types of co-ops cannot be sold for market value, he would instead get back his mother’s initial limited-equity investment, which was probably a few thousand dollars, plus amortization. His payout would probably total around $20,000 — a modest sum in today’s heady real estate market and hardly an incentive to give up the keys. And here is where the issue could make the next family gathering awkward: If another family member lived with your mother-in-law for at least two years before she died, then he or she could claim succession rights and try to take over the unit. “The real question is, who is in the apartment?” said Dean Roberts, a lawyer who specializes in limited-equity housing. “That’s where the succession issue comes into play.”

But its grand arcade, designed by Cass Gilbert, has never lost the distinction of being the most sumptuous office lobby in New York, with a dazzling mosaic ceiling that brings a delectable taste of the Byzantine Empire to Lower Manhattan.

“Its owner thought of it as a monument for public view,” the Landmarks Preservation Commission said in 1983, when declaring the tower an official city landmark, “and Cass Gilbert brought to the interior the same type of treatment he accorded public monuments.”

One problem: The grand arcade has been off limits to the public for more than a decade.

Oh, you can walk through the Woolworth lobby if you look purposeful enough and are destined for one of the building’s tenants. But don’t dare pause for even a moment to contemplate what the commission called “one of the finest skyscraper interiors in New York and one of the most significant nationwide.”

As Mr. Gilbert’s great-granddaughter, Helen Post Curry, put it, “If your jaw drops, you’re out of here.”

In a 2006 sampling of landmark interiors downtown, I found that the Woolworth security staff was the quickest to bar entry, only 12 seconds after I walked through the door.

To emphasize the ban, the Witkoff Group, which bought the building in 1998 from the remnants of F.W. Woolworth & Company, posted a sign outside the main entrance on Broadway: “Tourists are not permitted beyond this point.”

Lately, however, visitors have found a heartening addendum: “Guided lobby tours are offered at www.woolworthtours.com.”

Quietly and promisingly, a partnership has developed between Witkoff and Ms. Curry, an interior designer and color consultant in New Canaan, Conn.

It began in the planning of the building’s centenary in 2013, when Ms. Curry met with Roy A. Suskin, the vice president for development at Witkoff, who knows the tower inside and out. (He can even tell you that the building may not be 792 feet tall, as just about every reference work states, since the plans indicated that it would be 787 feet 6 inches from a benchmark at the northwest corner of the building.)

At first, the idea was to give a day of tours during the April celebration. Those were subscribed so quickly, Ms. Curry said, that she asked Mr. Suskin if two days of tours might be offered. He agreed. “Fortunately,” she said, “it went off perfectly. People were thanking him.”

Then it was Mr. Suskin’s turn to approach Ms. Curry, about a month later. “If you want to organize tours on a regular basis, we should talk,” she recalls him saying. Did she ever. “There is a tremendous pent-up demand,” Ms. Curry said.

Woolworth Tours now offers 30-, 60- and 90-minute tours almost every day, conducted by a number of knowledgeable and well-recognized guides. The group cautions in advance that walk-ins cannot be accommodated, that no restrooms are available and that there is no place to sit during the tour.

On the other hand, photographs are permitted, which ought to delight anyone who has been waiting more than a decade to zoom in on the scarlet parrots of the mosaic vaults, or the delightful sculptural grotesques depicting Frank W. Woolworth, holding one of the nickels that created his five-and-dime empire, and Mr. Gilbert, contemplating a model of his tower.

(The tours will not affect a separate new lobby planned on Park Place as part of the residential conversion of the upper 30 stories by Alchemy Properties, which bought the top of the building from Witkoff and its partner in 2012.)

Tours range from $20 to $45. Ms. Curry said she and her brother, Charles, pay a “small” fee to Witkoff for each visitor and also pay the guides.

Mr. Suskin said the guided tours, which had been suggested by one of his interns, Lisa Renz, allowed people to see the lobby while not interfering with operations or security. He said the management had no choice but to impose a no-sightseeing rule in the late 1990s, when the entrance to the grand arcade grew so crowded with tourists that tenants could barely get through.

“Tenants have a higher priority than anyone,” Mr. Suskin said. “Like everyone else, they have to get to work and have free access to their offices.” Magnificent as it is, the grand arcade is so narrow that it takes only one admirer blocking the doorway to tie up lobby traffic.

The landmarks commission said through a spokeswoman that it was “very pleased” that the grand arcade was once again publicly accessible. Though the agency has little power to compel greater public access, Robert B. Tierney, the chairman under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, had tried to use his powers of persuasion with Witkoff.

Mr. Suskin said the lobby could not operate efficiently with groups of tourists showing up unannounced. “It is no different,” he said, “than anyone else finding it a problem to have 45 people standing in their front door when they are trying to get to work.”

Mr. Fieg, 32, has spent seven years creating limited-edition kicks for various brands, along the way developing his own clothing line, Kith, and two Kith boutiques. “Ronnie built slowly and just kept getting bigger,” said Bobbito Garcia, author of “Where’d You Get Those? New York City’s Sneaker Culture: 1960-1987.” On a recent afternoon at his newly expanded shop on lower Broadway, Mr. Fieg wore a pair of burgundy New Balance 530 sneakers that he designed in a Central Park theme, with a modified parks department logo on the tongue. He lives with his girlfriend, Shir Yaakov, who is studying to be a speech pathologist, in a rental in the financial district, “because it’s very quiet after work,” he said.

A glimpse of Ronnie Fieg’s Sunday routine.

ONLINE EARLY I wake up the same time every day. I wake up at 7:30. I don’t drink coffee. The first thing I do is, I check my email. I turn over and check my phone. I’m dealing with Japan right now, so a lot of stuff is time sensitive.

BOTTOM TO TOP Picking out my outfit starts with the extensive shoe closet. Depending on which shoes I haven’t worn in a while or how I feel — it’s like a mood ring. If it’s raining out, if it’s gloomy out, if it’s sunny out, I’ll pick my footwear. It starts there, and I’ll work my way up.

HEALTHY START On Sundays my girlfriend cooks an amazing meal. We split it up. Either she cooks a very healthy meal, so it’s eggs and vegetables, and a smoothie of lots of different vegetables, or we go to Café Mogador on Saint Marks, where I have halloumi eggs, one of my favorite dishes.

SHOP DUTY I’ll go to the store for a couple hours after that. When I come into the shop I like to see the traffic, and see the split of what people do when they walk in the door. Are they turning right, or left? I like to people-watch a lot. That’s something that I do when I travel. But there’s no better place to do it than New York City. You see every different culture.

NAVIGATING CRAZINESS I take a walk in the West Village. I’ll take Bleecker all the way down to Hudson, and down along the West Side. That’ll take two or three hours of my day. It’s the best walk. And if it’s not freezing outside, it’s very relaxing. I try to relax as much as I can on Sundays. It’s the day between craziness and the beginning of craziness. I’m not really looking to gain inspiration for a project. It’s more to enjoy life. Having a girlfriend now definitely helps to do that.

DOWNTOWN FILM Usually on Sunday I’ll go see a movie. If a movie comes out on a Friday, definitely I will not see it on Friday. I’ll see it Sunday at the Battery Park movie theater, because it’s always dead.

REFUEL AS A REGULAR Most Sundays, if I go see a movie, I’ll grab a burger at Shake Shack. Since that’s a very unhealthy option, I try not to do that every week, but they’re so good. If we don’t go to Shake Shack we might go to Nobu in TriBeCa or Carbone in the Village. We go to Red Farm a lot, sometimes when they open at 5. They have a spot for me usually. They know me there.

FORTRESS After dinner I go home. Usually I watch “Game of Thrones” when it’s on. I love films. Films and music, that’s what makes my life go round, outside of product and work. I’m not really an indie film guy, even though I might eventually get into that.

GOLDEN TIME After the TV, if we have enough energy, we’ll go to Gold Bar on Broome and Centre Market. Sunday is a big night there. If we don’t, we’ll go to sleep. I go to bed somewhere between 1 and 2. I have a difficult time falling asleep, so I try to do nothing. If I watch anything or read, I have the personality that I get really into it. It’s hard for me to lose focus. Sunday night is actually the worst for me, because I’m thinking about what’s to come on Monday. So it’s harder for me to fall asleep Sunday night than any other night. My poor girlfriend can’t be happy with the situation right now. I keep her awake.

Interrogation Drew on Psychology to Induce ‘Helplessness’,1970-01-01 00:33:34.121119,"The dogs wouldn’t jump. All they had to do to avoid electric shocks was leap over a small barrier, but there they sat in boxes in a lab at the University of Pennsylvania, passive and whining.

They had previously been given a series of mild shocks and learned they could do nothing to stop them. Now, they had given up trying. In the words of the scientists, they had “learned helplessness.”

The release of a Senate report on interrogation techniques used by the Central Intelligence Agency has revived interest in that study, one of the most classic experiments in modern psychology. It and others like it, performed in the 1960s, became the basis for an influential theory about depression and informed the development of effective talk therapies.

Nearly a half-century later, a pair of military psychologists became convinced that the theory provided a basis for brutal interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, that were supposed to eliminate detainees’ “sense of control and predictability” and induce “a desired level of helplessness,” the Senate report said. The architects of the C.I.A.'s interrogation program have been identified as James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen.

The Central Intelligence Agency used waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other techniques on dozens of the men it detained in secret prisons between 2002 and 2008.

“My impression is that they misread the theory,” said Dr. Charles A. Morgan III, a psychiatrist at the University of New Haven who met Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Jessen while studying the effects of stress on American troops. “They’re not really scientists.”

One of the researchers who conducted the initial studies on dogs, the prominent psychologist Martin E. P. Seligman, said he was “grieved and horrified” that his work was cited to justify the abusive interrogations.

It is not the first time that academic research has been used for brutal interrogations, experts said. After the Second World War, the intelligence community began to study methods of interrogation, often financing outside psychiatrists and psychologists.

“A lot of the early work came out of psychoanalysis,” or Freudian thinking, said Steven Reisner, a psychologist in New York and co-founder of the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, which opposes the profession’s participation in coercive interrogations. “Studies of sensory deprivation and sleep deprivation induced a psychosis, in which people lost control of what they said and what they thought.” At that point they might begin to cooperate — or so the theory went, Mr. Reisner said.

One interrogation guide derived in part from such research, the C.I.A.'s “Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual,” set forth the so-called D.D.D method of interrogation, for Debility, Dependency and Dread. “The purpose of all coercive techniques is to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist,” the manual reads.

Some of the techniques in the manual — isolation, sleep deprivation, threats — were also used in the post-9/11 interrogations and are cited by the Senate report. “It’s very similar to what we’re hearing about now, and it’s astounding that the agency didn’t use the research it had already paid for,” said Stephen Soldz of the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis, referring to D.D.D. He is an outspoken critic of psychologists’ participation in interrogations.

The American Psychological Association, divided and convulsed by the revelations of members’ participation in the interrogation program, has hired an independent auditor to investigate ties between the association and the intelligence agency. Debates over psychologists’ role at the base in Guantánamo Bay and so-called black sites have raged for years within the association.

The two architects of the C.I.A. interrogations were convinced that they would uncover intelligence that would save lives, their colleagues have told reporters, and that their methods were justified by the events of 9/11 and afterward.

So, too, were psychologists within the agency. In an article titled “Psychologists and Interrogation: What’s Torture Got to Do With It?” Kirk M. Hubbard, a psychologist formerly with the C.I.A., wrote, justifying the methods, “We no longer live in a world where people agree on what is ethical or even acceptable, and where concern for other humans transcends familial ties. When adolescents carry bombs on their bodies and plan suicides that will kill others, we know that shared values no longer exist.”

The Senate report concludes that the brutal techniques did not add valuable information to what had been already obtained through less coercive means. Critics of the report, in Congress and in the C.I.A., say the conclusions do not tell the full story.

Academic research on interrogation — whether it is “learned helplessness” or other methods — cannot be tested in an ethical way in the real world, and provides little guidance for effective questioning, experts say.

Severe stress disrupts people’s thinking, and fast. Dr. Morgan recently studied American troops’ levels of compliance and suggestibility after the Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) course, a training exercise that includes what he calls a “mini-exposure” to many of the interrogation techniques the C.I.A. was using, including confinement and sleep deprivation. The result: a subset became more compliant, but the vast majority also became more suggestible when given misinformation. “Essentially you’re making people less reliable and more stupid,” he said. “You can see the problem.”

Some experienced interrogators emphasize the value of establishing rapport with a detainee, and obtaining information on the basis of trust, rather than cruelty. “As both an interrogator and someone who has served in senior intelligence positions, I would not trust any information obtained through the employment of D.D.D. or learned helplessness,” said Steven M. Kleinman, an interrogator who worked in Iraq and has been critical of the C.I.A.'s program.

An earlier version of this article misstated the middle initial of a psychologist who conducted the initials studies on “learned helplessness” in dogs. He is Martin E. P. Seligman, not Martin J. Seligman. It also misstated the name of an association of psychologists. It is The American Psychological — not Psychology — Association.

New Yorkers want to know: Who are these people who hide behind limited liability companies while shelling out a fortune for a condominium — who see the apartment as an investment or even just a vanity play, and who are too busy sunning in St. Bart’s or skiing in Gstaad to actually show up and shop at the local market or pay for tickets to a Broadway show?

Many well-heeled New Yorkers are frustrated that while a large share of their income goes to taxes of all kinds, their non-New Yorker neighbors down the street pay a comparatively minuscule amount in property taxes. And an evening stroll through Midtown is starting to feel like the Wild West after the gold rush, with buildings like the Plaza — officially the Plaza Pied a Terre Hotel Condominiums — sitting mostly dark. It wouldn’t surprise some of us to see tumbleweed blow by the Apple cube on Fifth Avenue.

As it turns out, this is not just hyperbole.

In a three-block stretch of Midtown, from East 56th Street to East 59th Street, between Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue, 57 percent, or 285 of 496 apartments, including co-ops and condos, are vacant at least 10 months a year. From East 59th Street to East 63rd Street, 628 of 1,261 homes, or almost 50 percent, are vacant the majority of the time, according to data from the Census Bureau’s 2012 American Community Survey.

“My district has some of the most expensive land values in the world — I’m ground zero for the issue of foreign buyers,” said State Senator Liz Krueger, whose district includes Midtown. “I met with a developer who is building one of those billionaire buildings on 57th Street and he told me, ‘Don’t worry, you won’t need any more services, because the buyers won’t be sending their kids to school here, there won’t be traffic.’ ”

The developer told her that the buyers basically would never be here, Ms. Krueger said. “He said it like this was a positive thing,” she added. “You can’t make this stuff up.”

While the Census Bureau data is illuminating, it does not drill down into individual buildings. This is not easily done, although one method is to track a city property tax break given only to full-time residents. In years past, the 17.5 percent tax abatement was widely available for owners of cooperatives and condominiums, but after a rule change was enacted last year, only those who are deemed primary residents are eligible to claim it.

Tracking this tax abatement can turn up some interesting details. Take the Trump Tower at 721 Fifth Avenue, between East 56th Street and East 57th Street. The building has 237 units, with some priced at more than $25 million. As of last year, 211 apartments claimed the tax abatement, but this year, as a result of the rule change, the city decided that only 108 apartments were eligible, according to figures from the Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan city agency. That is a drop of nearly 50 percent and means that fewer than half of the apartments in the building are primary residences.

At the Plaza, of 163 condominiums, only 58, or about one-third of them, now receive the abatement for full-time residents.

Some of the city’s most exclusive addresses, such as 15 Central Park West and One57, receive a far more lucrative tax break — the so-called 421a tax exemption — and so they cannot be tracked this way.

George Sweeting, the deputy director of the Independent Budget Office, said the agency plans to look further into how tracking the tax abatement for primary residents could shed light on the number of pieds-à-terre across the city.

It is an important endeavor, according to Brad Hoylman, the state senator who is proposing legislation to charge an additional tax to owners of expensive pieds-à-terre. According to the proposal, owners of a pied-à-terre priced between $5 million and $6 million would pay 0.5 percent of the amount over the $5 million threshold in annual taxes. This would gradually increase, capping off at properties of more than $25 million, where the owner would pay a $370,000 annual fee plus 4 percent of the amount over $25 million.

While the owners could be wealthy New Yorkers who happen to own a primary residence uptown, say, and a secondary apartment downtown, many who would be targeted by this new tax would be non-New York residents. These nonresidents typically do not pay New York’s hefty income taxes and instead pay just a small fraction of their apartment’s value in property taxes. Property taxes here are based on a complex equation related to rental values and can be very low. At One57, for example, a unit that sold for nearly $3.6 million is estimated by the city to have a market value of just $430,000 when calculating its property tax.

“The pied-à-terre tax is seen by New York’s wealthiest 1 percent as a question of fairness,” said James Parrott, the chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, who first made the proposal for the tax on which Mr. Hoylman based his legislation. “Here they are in the top tax bracket paying the top New York City and New York State income tax rates, but these non-primary residents are just paying property taxes, and the effective property tax rates are so incredibly low.”

Before Mr. Parrott released his proposal earlier this year, “I heard more about the need for a pied-à-terre tax from high-income New York City residents than anybody else.”

Although Mr. Hoylman is not interested in leveling the playing field among the very rich, he is concerned that “these property owners aren’t paying their fair share of taxes.”

“The city is leaving considerable money on the table by having such an abundance of these types of properties that are owned by nonresidents,” he said.

But there could be stumbling blocks to passing a tax on expensive pieds-à-terre. Chief among them may be the issue of its constitutionality.

“If you said you are going to impose a special surcharge on apartments that are worth more than $20 million, that would be perfectly legal,” said Peter L. Faber, a partner at McDermott Will & Emery. “But the problem comes when you start imposing a special tax on nonresidents. That is unconstitutional under the interstate commerce clause.”

Mr. Hoylman’s proposal does not specifically target nonresidents. But because the majority of those who would be paying the tax would most likely be non-primary residents, it could still be legally questionable, said Mr. Faber, who was the former chairman of the American Bar Association’s Section of Taxation. “It could be similar to the voter ID case in Texas, where the judge ruled that even though it wasn’t explicit, in effect it discriminated against minorities,” he said.

The census data, nonetheless, may tell New York City natives a few things they didn’t know about the city. When reviewing residency data around town, you can see that in certain pockets of the Financial District, for example, the vacancy rate hovers between 6 percent and more than 55 percent, depending on where you look. And some of the lowest vacancy figures can be found in Brooklyn Heights and the West Village, at around 10 percent.

This data is now two years old, and New York City, of course, is a place of constant change. Many new buildings are being built along the Brooklyn waterfront and downtown, and if you look along West 57th Street, for example, the Census Bureau information does not tell the whole story. Only around 23 percent of the apartments there are vacant for most of the year, but this doesn’t include the many new ultra-pricey condominiums that are being constructed. They will certainly attract many buyers who are new, and perhaps some who will remain unknown, to the city.",The Census Bureau tracks vacancy rates to find out who lives in Manhattan full time.,100.75,0.875,1.375,high,medium,abstractive,architecture

The initiative is part of a pledge, to be announced before the start of the United Nations Climate Summit on Tuesday, to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 from 2005 levels. The United Nations has pointed to that rate of decrease as a desired target for developed countries to mitigate the effects of climate change.

New York would become the largest city in the world to make the commitment, according to the city’s leaders.

Though the proposal is likely to rankle some residential and commercial building owners, who will bear a portion of its cost, officials have framed the issue in part as an extension of the citywide focus on income inequality since Mayor Bill de Blasio took office in January. High energy costs, the de Blasio administration argues, amount to a regressive tax, because lower-income residents by and large pay a higher share of their rent for energy than wealthier residents, and often live in less-efficient buildings. The long-term savings could prove to be a financial boost for lower-income residents, officials said — to say nothing of the environmental benefits.

Such ambitions, though, will come at a significant near-term price: At least $1 billion of its capital funding alone will be devoted to enhancing the city-owned buildings over the next decade, the administration said, excluding the cost of the private building alterations and other changes. Though the city’s many competing financial interests mean there are typically few spending guarantees, particularly on projects intended to span decades, officials insist the money will be incorporated in its 10-year capital plan, to be released early next year.

“Global warming was much more of an abstraction to New York City until two years ago,” Mr. de Blasio said in an interview on Friday, alluding to Hurricane Sandy, which in 2012 caused 44 deaths and resulted in $19 billion of damage to the city. “There’s a moral imperative to act.”

But with a global audience looking toward New York this week, as world leaders including President Obama converge to discuss climate change, Mr. de Blasio is training attention not just on its waterfront but on its skyline: The city — dense and walkable, with an extensive subway system — has long been more environmentally friendly than most. As a result, nearly three-quarters of emissions come from energy used in buildings.

Possible upgrades will range from changes like lighting or boiler improvements to solar-power installations and the introduction of an “air conditioner exchange program” in public housing, where the units tend to be older and less efficient.

The measures are intended to help the city take a significant step toward a “complete transition away from fossil fuels,” according to a 111-page draft report on the proposals.

In total, the city said, building-based greenhouse gas emissions are expected to fall an additional 10 percent by 2025, the equivalent of removing more than 700,000 vehicles from the road.

Over the last several years, and particularly since Hurricane Sandy, the city has aimed to protect itself better from extreme weather. Months before leaving office, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent, proposed a $20 billion storm protection plan for a sprawling network of flood walls, levees and bulkheads, among other initiatives — a vision that Mr. de Blasio has largely moved to adopt and expand. The Bloomberg administration also published a report last December discussing strategies to further reduce emissions by 2050, many of which are included in the city’s latest plan.

Boston, San Francisco and Stockholm are among cities that have made similar commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, who plans to participate in the People’s Climate March in Manhattan on Sunday, predicted his program would prompt other cities to follow. “We know when New York City acts, it helps move policy in other places,” he said.

The administration said it could complete many of the changes unilaterally; others will require support from the City Council, which unveiled a related package of legislation on Friday.

In the early months of Mr. de Blasio’s term, he faced modest criticism from some environmental advocates, who suggested he had not provided enough details on his climate plans, and for not yet naming a permanent leader for the city’s Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability.

But groups briefed on the plan on Friday gave it generally high marks. Donna DeCostanzo of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the package of building changes “could be the most far-reaching one of its kind.”

Others pointed to the potential cost reductions. By 2025, according to the city’s estimates, the upgrades will yield more than $1.4 billion per year in savings.

The de Blasio administration also plans to expand an existing mandate requiring buildings over 50,000 square feet to track and disclose energy use annually and upgrade lighting. Under the change, any building larger than 25,000 square feet would be subject to the requirements, bringing as many as 16,000 buildings in the five boroughs under the mandate for the first time.

Building on programs adopted by the state — which in 2009 set its own goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 from 1990 levels — city officials will also offer grants and other incentives to owners. As part of a “green grant program” for affordable housing, officials said, the city will pay for efficiency upgrades if owners agree to preserve lower-cost units in a given building.

Though some landlords seem likely to resist the changes without legal prodding, the city’s push earned praise from the leader of the powerful Real Estate Board of New York. Rob Speyer, the board’s chairman, said in a statement that the mayor’s goals of increased energy efficiency and reduced emissions would “help solidify New York’s standing as the world’s model of sustainability.”

City officials said many New York real estate owners had already embraced “green” buildings, citing their operational savings and attractiveness to some high-end renters. Anthony E. Shorris, the first deputy mayor, said many owners were “already doing some of these things for pure economic reasons.”

The city would not say when a more aggressive mandate might be applied if owners failed to adopt the necessary changes on their own. Mr. de Blasio said there was “a growing understanding in the private sector that this is everyone’s problem.”

“If we don’t see progress,” he added, “we will certainly move to mandate.”

And Patrik wanted the new structure to overshoot the fire station and land on a single point.”

Ms. Hadid and Mr. Schumacher reviewed and changed numerous options developed mainly by Mr. Pauwels, based on the initial concept. From the beginning of her career, Ms. Hadid lofted her buildings, defying gravity: Air has been her design habitat.

The architects perched the four-story, 60,000-square-foot volume of new offices on a leaning, sculpted column housing a fire escape that meets the ground like a Louboutin heel, and on an elevator core rising up from the original courtyard. A tall space between old and new buildings is a promenade deck for viewing and receptions.

Inside the addition, all floors are open-plan offices with rows of desks arranged on the bias; the triangulated walls offer circumferential views of the city and the vast Scheldt estuary. In the brick firehouse, the architects stripped decades of accretions down to a shell that they restored inside and out; their new glass roof transformed the courtyard into a reception area (now used to exhibit Ms. Hadid’s work).

What provoked the “wows” often heard on Zaha Hadid Square is that the architects threw the hovering volume off balance, first by planting the addition off-center, to maximize light into the courtyard, and then by bending and stretching its shape, as though driven and distorted by invisible forces.

The whole volume lists like a ship under sail, capturing the movement of a boat that, counterintuitively, looks as though it’s suspended in dry dock. Halfway down, the flat planes of the leaning sidewalls crack into a tessellated field of triangles that reflect light, activating the surfaces and dynamizing the shape. Edges are cut and beveled, sometimes for views, sometimes for interior stairways. At night, the whole structure resembles a huge suspended urban lantern competing with the moon.

Like all of Ms. Hadid’s projects, especially in recent years, the design was produced by a firm that she structured, Mr. Schumacher said, “to encourage the survival of the best idea — an office that could think for itself.” Despite the popular perception of Ms. Hadid as a stand-alone design force, even a diva, she ran an open office where, according to Mr. Pauwels, ideas flowed democratically rather than hierarchically.

Within the general principles she had broadly developed during 35 years of practice, Ms. Hadid, Mr. Schumacher and other architects, both senior and junior, brainstormed ideas together, and the younger design architects would then develop proposals that would lead to further sketches. “There was no recipe for design,” Mr. Pauwels said “She wanted to push boundaries.”

Ms. Hadid and Mr. Schumacher made the final decision together. He said that she had offered to share the masthead with him before she died, but he declined: “It was better to keep the focus on Zaha, and to avoid diluting our identity if there were eventually other partners’ names to add.”

If little has changed in the design process, the office that she had run for years as an informal, very personal atelier is more structured. Over the last dozen years, it grew to 400 from 40. “We couldn’t have hundreds of people on a zero hierarchy,” Mr. Schumacher said. “We restructured, organizing clusters under collegial leadership” and adding mechanisms to handle financial accountability. He noted that despite aggressive head hunting by some of London’s most prominent firms, no one had left. He is now the principal owner of Zaha Hadid Architects, though he said the details of the ownership were still to be determined.

Since Ms. Hadid’s death, the office has received several major commissions, among them a mixed-use central business district in Prague with nearly a million square feet of offices and retail, and the Sberbank Technopark headquarters in Moscow, said to be Russia’s answer to Silicon Valley. Several high-rises and a vast airport in Beijing are under construction. “Due to scale, we are looking for new drivers to give character and identity to buildings, new structural and environmental logics that will give buildings a new physiognomy,” Mr. Schumacher said.

Clarifying how the Hadid DNA would endure even at a vastly larger, technologically driven scale that normally homogenizes design, he continued: “We want to bring technical ideas into an expressive area. Zaha believed in research, and of course, our interests in research will change. We’ve looked at shells in Saudi Arabia, tensile structures in London, new ideas for skeletons in Miami, New York and Chicago, and we’re looking at the mega atriums that Atlanta architect John Portman built into his hotels.”

There are headwinds. Though Mr. Schumacher has strongly stated that he favors “Brexit,” to liberate British offices from the European Union’s regulatory environment, the London-based office will possibly lose access to competitions required by the European Union for large public projects. “‘Brexit’ could impact us,” he said. “It might exclude us.”

Then there is the issue of profits: “So far we have made profits only on a minority of projects, and often pay for the last project with the new project,” he said. “You can do that if you’re stable or growing, and we’re growing, but shrinking is a problem. We’re not allowed to shrink.”

There remains one potential issue of Zaha Hadid Architects without Zaha Hadid: Will the firm have the magnetic power to draw prestigious institutional and cultural clients without its charismatic leader? “For a long time, we’ve had a very distributed leadership and collective design process, so that won’t change,” Mr. Schumacher said. “But I’m not so well known in the project world of clients, and the question is, Will I have the credibility to attract commissions of cultural significance? For me, without Zaha, that will be the challenge.”

This year’s edition, directed by Rem Koolhaas, gets back to the basics of modern architecture, with dozens of exhibitions at national pavilions that delve into formative moments of the 20th century. The Swiss Pavilion is headed by Hans-Ulrich Obrist, the omnivorous curator and co-director of exhibitions and programs at the Serpentine Galleries in London. In it, Obrist has brought together two 20th-century figures whose research has influenced architectural thinking in their own time and since: the Swiss political economist Lucius Burckhardt and the English architect Cedric Price. Here, Obrist walks through the genesis of the pavilion’s exhibition “A Stroll Through a Fun Palace,” whose title refers to Price’s great unrealized construction, “Fun Palace,” and Burckhardt’s concept of “Strollology.”

How would you describe Rem Koolhaas’s overall concept for the Biennale?

It’s very often that the future is invented through the past, and all the pavilions revisit moments from the 20th century in some kind of way. When I asked Rem the other day what triggered this interest, he told me that the kind of trigger was a disenchantment with architecture. He was not impressed with how the city was becoming more the subject of space and how the Biennale has a kind of obsession with recreating architecture and knowledge. So there is an intuition here to go back into architectural knowledge and break the practice down to its fundamentals by creating spaces dedicated to particular building elements — the floor, the wall, the ceiling, the window, the door, the fireplace, the toilet, the ramp, the escalator, the elevator — almost like a Georges Perec list, but Rem’s connection to literature is another story.

What was the impetus for you to curate a pavilion?

The Swiss ministry Pro Helvetia invited me to come up with an idea, offering a carte blanche for the pavilion. The only thing they said was that they wanted it to be like a new “Utopia Station.” That was the exhibition that I did with Rirkrit Tiravanija and Molly Nesbit for the 2003 art biennale, where lots of artists addressed this question of utopia and the project developed into a physical and a conceptual structure, a place and a non-place. It was an exhibition that produced nonstop conversations. The Swiss ministry wanted me to revisit this idea of an exhibition being a laboratory and a place where permanent things will be produced, because very often with Biennales you have all this energy on the opening day and then everybody goes home and the visitors arrive and no new content is produced anymore. With this project the idea is that it’s a nonstop content machine. This reminded me of many of the conversations I had with Cedric Price around this whole idea of an organization that has fast lanes, slow lanes and all kinds of unexpected functions that could take place.

Did you know Burckhardt as well?

Yes, Burckhardt I met basically in my childhood and Price I met through Richard Hamilton in the 1990s. With both, a very close dialogue unfolded that continued until they died. Since the idea was to revisit figures from the past, I wanted to revisit these two visionaries from the architecture and urbanism world whom I had done exhibitions with in the 1990s at the Musee d’art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. Price’s “Fun Palace” was always an obsession of mine — it’s sort of the idea that it would invite all kinds of choreographies of shows and time-based exhibitions and foster a communal experience. Both Price and Burckhardt changed the world of architecture and urbanism with very few means.

Did Price never build a building?

He did. He built the aviary at the London Zoo, which was one of his very few realized buildings, and then there was the InterAction Centre, which was destroyed a few years before he died. A big protest erupted around the idea of this historically important building in the U.K. being destroyed, and Cedric thought it was a great idea for it to be destroyed because it was actually never meant to last.

How long have you had a project in mind that would place the two of them in conversation?

It was somehow always my unrealized project to bring them together. Both are inventors. Burckhardt invented “strollology,” which is the science of going on a stroll, which he implemented at the university in Kassel. For him design was invisible and architecture should contemplate circumstances, also environmental circumstances that are outlying a city’s built environment. The environmental and social circumstances are common points between Burckhardt and Price, and maybe another is that both have a very intense practice of drawing. That was another point of departure.

How has visual art developed as an element of the pavilion?

Based on Burkhardt and Price’s archives as a kind of dramaturgy, Lorenza Baroncelli, who is the artistic director with me, and I have invited artists like Tino Seghal, Asad Raza, Dominique Gonzalez-Forrester and Phillipe Parreno to work with us to develop the choreography for the show, of how to show the archives every hour, every day, differently. There are lots of trolleys as a display feature, in which original materials are constantly moved and rearranged. Another link between Burckhardt and Price is they both inspired a lot of visual artists, so this choreography of an exhibition also includes time-based homages by artists including Carsten Höller, Koo Jeong-A and Dan Graham in his first architecture biennial. Dan is the artist who introduced me to architecture as a teenager for the first time. He was absolutely charmed by my lack of knowledge about architecture and said I should read Rem Koolhaas, and that I should read Cedric Price.

The next step was to invite Herzog and de Meuron to do the exhibition design, and the longer they worked on it the more immaterial it became, so that in the end really all that we have floating in the space are Burckhardt and Price’s mental universes. The next layer is that there are all these schools. The choreography will unfold for six months; every day, there will be different schools inhabiting the space. There will always be ETI students from Zurich, in a collaboration with the curators Fredi Fischli and Niels Olsen from ETI, which is also where Lucius used to teach. Everything is in permanent flux. It’s not about occupying the space, it’s about things popping up.","The omnivorous curator discusses “A Stroll Through a Fun Palace,” his exhibition that explores the connections between two late-20th-century architectural thinkers: the architect Cedric Price and the political economist Lucius Burckhardt.",33.0789473684,0.8684210526,3.6052631579,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

PAUL, Minn. — President Obama on Wednesday will call on Congress to overhaul corporate and business taxes as a way to pay for a four-year, $302 billion transportation bill to repair and replace the nation’s aging roads, rails, bridges and tunnels.

Mr. Obama will travel to a renovated transit hub in St. Paul to pitch the plan publicly. On Tuesday, the president made the case for the funding privately to House Speaker John A. Boehner in an hourlong Oval Office meeting, according to officials with knowledge of the conversation.

In his State of the Union address last month, Mr. Obama pledged to use money from a tax overhaul to “create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes, because in today’s global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure.”

New legislation to pay for transportation is a priority for both parties because the nation’s Highway Trust Fund is nearing insolvency. Anthony Foxx, the transportation secretary, has said the trust fund could begin “bouncing checks” by this summer. That would force a halt to construction projects around the country, officials have said.

But differences remain unresolved about how to pay for the work.

Mr. Boehner, who has said that Republicans are eager to overhaul and simplify the corporate tax system, nonetheless expressed skepticism to Mr. Obama on Tuesday about the president’s proposal to finance transportation spending with business tax changes, officials said. Mr. Obama argued that the transportation bill will create jobs and help increase economic growth, they said.

Republicans on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning said they want to see more details from the president about the changes he is seeking to business taxes. The White House has so far declined to be specific, and Republicans in the past have balked at administration proposals to use revenue from closing tax loopholes.

“So, a tax hike?” one senior Republican aide on Capitol Hill quipped when asked about the transportation proposals.

Still, some members of both parties have expressed some optimism about the eventual possibility of a compromise on a transportation bill, even in an otherwise gridlocked Congress whose members are facing re-election in a matter of months.

House Republicans on Wednesday released their own proposal for a broad tax overhaul that would cut the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and reduce the number of individual income tax brackets to two from seven. A spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said lawmakers would review the president’s proposal.

White House officials said Mr. Obama’s plan would use savings from business tax changes for a one-time, $150 billion infusion of cash into the trust fund to make it solvent. Officials said the White House is open to other ideas, but stressed that something must be done soon.

“If Congress doesn’t act to ensure critical transportation programs continue to be funded and do not expire later this year, more than 700,000 jobs will be put at risk,” the White House said in a document released Wednesday previewing Mr. Obama’s remarks.

Transportation spending in the United States is financed primarily through the imposition of an 18.4-cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline that raises about $39 billion. But that rate has not been raised in decades, and revenue to the fund is declining rapidly as more fuel-efficient cars mean people are using less gasoline.

There has been almost no appetite in Congress for an increase in the federal gas tax, and Mr. Obama has said he opposes one.

In the meantime, the amount of spending on transportation projects around the country is already outstripping the money coming into the trust fund. In the last several years, the federal government had to shift money from other funds to cover the shortfall in the trust fund for projects already underway.","President Obama will ask Congress to overhaul corporate and business taxes to pay for a four-year, $302 billion transportation bill.",29.4,0.96,8.96,medium,high,extractive,architecture

Those are big players, and the Icelanders enjoy them immensely on the long, dark nights up there near the Arctic Circle.

But Friday will bring soccer fever closer to Icelandâs doors than ever before. Iceland, population 325,010, is two games away from reaching its first World Cup finals.

Croatia, by no means a giant with its own population under 4.5 million, stands between the Nordic island and the dream. But Croatia, which went very nearly all the way in 1998 when it finished third in the World Cup, would be mistaken if it swallowed the line about Icelandâs being the smallest nation ever to qualify for the tournament finals.

Physically, the Icelanders are strapping athletes. Emotionally, their people are so motivated by this match that almost 10,000 tickets for the stadium in Reykjavik sold out before sunrise, even though the sale was posted unannounced on the Web at 4 in the morning.

The reason for that clandestine sale was that the national soccer federation, the KSI, feared the site would crash if tickets were put online in daylight. The Laugardal Stadium can hold 15,427, but Croatians are as soccer-crazy as the Icelanders. They follow their team to the ends of the earth, and come rain, wind and chill â which are in the forecast â they will be there.

So, even in an arena that is open to the elements, Reykjavik is the hottest ticket in town.

Who will win this, and the return match Tuesday in Zagreb? It is a remarkably close call. Croatia has vastly more experience, epitomized by Darijo Srna, who has represented his country 108 times and has led the Ukraine club Shakhtar Donetsk with indefatigable zest as a cavalier defender since 2003.

Reykjavik will not daunt him. Nor should it scare the creative Real Madrid player Luka Modric or the Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic. However, the fact that Croatia is in this playoff, and not an automatic qualifier, speaks for itself.

This is not the Croatian team of 1998. That had Davor Suker, a finisher superior to Mandzukic. It had classy defenders in Igor Stimac and Slaven Bilic. It had wonderful technical players in Robert Prosinecki and Zvonimir Boban.

And they were driven by the nationalism arising out of the Balkan conflicts, so theirs was an especially galvanized Croatian generation.

Bilic almost recreated that spirit when he coached the national side from 2006-12. Bilic was replaced by Stimac, but last month Suker, now the head of the Croatian soccer federation, had to dismiss his former teammate.

After three defeats and a draw in four World Cup qualifying matches since June, Stimac was replaced by another former defender, Niko Kovac.

Kovac will make his debut as national coach on Friday. His adversary, the Iceland Coach Lars Lagerback, has the experience that Kovac lacks. âThe atmosphere probably wasnât the best in their squad,â Lagerback said after studying video of Croatiaâs recent defeats. âIt was not a team in harmony when they played Scotland, for example. I donât think it is an advantage to change the coach when you only get four or five training sessions to prepare for a game.â

Lagerback, the laid-back Swede, has been building this Iceland team since October 2011. He has 20 years experience in international soccer having coached Sweden and, briefly, the Nigerian national side.

He took the Icelandic challenge because he liked what he saw of the generation of players then emerging at the Under-21 level. Lagerback has no single dominant player as he had with Ibrahimovic in Sweden. Monetary reward was unlikely to have induced him because Iceland has yet to fully recover from its financial collapse in 2008.

But Lagerback, now 65, could see raw players coming through for him to organize into a World Cup candidate. His benchmark player, Eidur Gudjohnsen, is 35 and no longer the force he was with Chelsea. But Gudjohnsen still is useful, still is a positive person around the group, and still possesses what the coach calls âa wonderful football eye.â Gudjohnsenâs pivotal attacking role has been taken by Kolbeinn Sigporsson, the 23-year-old Ajax striker who has hit 13 goals in 19 appearances for Iceland. The key midfield direction comes from Tottenham Hotspurâs Gylfi Sigurdsson, another of the emerging talents who excited the coach.

Lagerbackâs way is to build around solid pillars, players who put the team first. And his captain Aron Einar Gunnarsson operates as the anchor of the midfield.

Lagerback picked Gunnarsson for his strength of character and his leadership of the maturing group. Gunnarsson had battled hard in England for what he now has, a place in the Premier League with newly promoted Cardiff City.

The language used between players and coach on the Icelandic team is English because of their Scandinavian languages are so different. But Gunnarsson easily articulates the strength of the coach. âHe succeeded in sharing his experience, and brought us a new philosophy,â said the captain. âHe believed we have huge potential, despite the small size of our country.â

The limitations are that the group itself is small. Take two or three individuals out and, unlike Croatia which has experienced players in reserve, Iceland struggles.

If Croatia is sagging on Friday, its new coach can turn to strikers on the bench, proven goal-scorers like Ivica Olic and the naturalized Brazilian Eduardo.

Iceland must hope that by that time, the result will be going the home sideâs way. No one will sleep in Reykjavik if that is the case; the party will go on and on among people who seem never to sleep.","Iceland, with a population of about 325,000, will become the smallest country ever to qualify for the World Cup finals if it can get past Croatia.",37.724137931,0.8965517241000001,2.0,high,medium,mixed,architecture

He may also want to pack a hard hat.

MORE REPAIRS When a new zinc-coated roof is installed next year at New Yorkâs City Hall, the bill for the current renovations will approach $150 million.

For much of the last two centuries, New Yorkâs City Hall has been a construction site. And now, for one thing, the nationâs oldest continuous seat of municipal government needs a new roof.

Repairs that began five years ago were supposed to have been completed in time for the buildingâs 2012 bicentennial. An early budget estimated the cost at $65 million. That the renovations have taken longer than expected â longer than Mayor Michael R. Bloombergâs final term â and have cost more than twice as much as projected will probably come as no surprise to any homeowner.

Construction of the wood-frame building began 210 years ago, and the building has survived several major fires. When the latest repairs were started in 2008, plaster was flaking from the second-floor ceilings, but nobody realized the buildingâs state of disrepair. A large plaster rosette later crashed from the dome and landed in the rotunda; nobody was hurt.

It was also discovered that the roof was in danger of collapsing. Scaffolding was erected to support the roof and to protect City Hall workers beneath it.

âEvery time you poke a screwdriver in the wall you discover some other problem,â said David J. Burney, the commissioner of the cityâs Department of Design and Construction.

Most of the interior construction was completed in October when the Public Design Commission, formerly the Art Commission, reclaimed its charming third-floor aerie surrounding the rotunda. The commissionâs return was considerably less eventful than when it first moved in, in 1914. At that time, the ailing City Hall custodian, John Ryan, had to be evicted from his third-floor apartment flanking the rotunda to make room (he was carried out on a chair).

âHe didnât go gracefully,â said Mary Beth Betts, the director of research for the cityâs Landmarks Preservation Commission.

Maybe that custodian could not fight City Hall, but Mr. Bloomberg successfully did when he refused to vacate his second-floor bullpen offices during renovations. (The City Council moved out in 2010 and returned in 2011 from offices across the street.) Mr. Bloombergâs successor, Bill de Blasio, has indicated he will do away with the bullpen, formerly the Board of Estimate chamber.

Even with the renovations nearly complete on New Yorkâs third City Hall, the French Renaissance gem looks much like it did before, only now it is a little more comfortable and safer.

âMuch of the work we did is truly invisible to improve livability and sustainability,â said David Resnick, the deputy commissioner for the Department of Design and Construction.

The makeover was not merely cosmetic, Salvatore Cali Jr., the project executive for the renovation, said. The installation of a fire sprinkler system, new exits and elevators belatedly brought City Hall into compliance with safety and environmental building codes, as well as those codes mandated by the Americans With Disabilities Act.

A solid oxide fuel cell behind the building now supplies more than half its electrical power. A new subcellar was built. Utilities were shoehorned into the attic. The menâs room entrance was removed from the Council chamber. And wood timbers, which were overtaxed from supporting a second roof and damaged by water, had to be shored up.

âThe trusses had essentially failed,â Mr. Resnick said, âand it was a possibility there could have been a collapse.â

The first City Hall, on Pearl Street, was built in 1642 by officials who were tired of entertaining at their homes; it doubled as a tavern and courthouse. It was abandoned at the end of the 17th century when jurors refused to convene there because they feared the roof would cave in.

The second City Hall, on the site of Federal Hall on Wall Street, was built in the early 1700s. For reasons lost to history, the building was called the âfoolâs trapâ in 1789. By the end of the 18th century, the building was in disrepair.","The next mayor of New York City will have to deal with the latest renovations of City Hall, including a new roof.",34.5416666667,0.9166666667000001,2.0833333333,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

Next-gen architecture sits, sometimes uncomfortably, alongside vernacular old-world buildings erected and modified by Persians, Byzantines, Ottomans, Russians and Soviets. More…

Rezo Gabriadze’s puppet theater stands in the heart of Tbilisi’s Old Town, which is very old indeed. Around the corner are the sulfur baths, where, according to legend, Georgian King Vakhtang I decided to build the city in the fifth century. Up the street is the great Sioni Cathedral from the seventh century.

Gabriadze himself is a Georgian national treasure. I saw his marionette version of the Battle of Stalingrad when I first came to Tbilisi 10 years ago and fell in love with the city. I was ushered into a dank, run-down basement, where I watched, enthralled, as Gabriadze’s tiny puppet tanks advanced to the rousing strains of Shostakovich. It was unforgettable.

The theater was a dump, but then, so was the rest of the city. The old buildings were missing many of the elegant narrow bricks first introduced there by the Byzantines. The covered balconies with their delicate latticework, a gift of the Ottomans, were listing and rotting. There was litter everywhere. An apartment’s garbage disposal was often its front window.

None of this made the city any less romantic or delightful. Houses still clung to the cliffs above the Kura river as they did centuries ago, looking as though they might suddenly lose their grip. A faint smell of sulfur hung over the shallow domes of the old baths, where Pushkin once ogled Georgian women bathing. From high up on the cliff, the stones of the ruined Narikala fortress gazed over the town from the fourth century, and the eighth, and the 13th, and the 17th.

History has played rough with Tbilisi for a very long time. Persians, Byzantines, Ottomans, Russians and Soviets have all had their way with her. Each has left a little of its best self there. The result is a city that Boris Pasternak called a chimera — a fanciful beast with a Western head and an Eastern body. Tbilisi has gotten even more fanciful recently. Italian architects have been busy with glass and steel, adding the sleek vernacular of modern capitalism to the city’s Babel of building styles.

The new buildings are striking, and some are beautiful. Do they belong here among the ruins of dead empires? It turns out that question is as much political as aesthetic. Georgia’s new buildings have become pawns in a power struggle over its place in the world. Does it belong in the cosmopolitan sphere of the European architects who built them? Or should it remain somewhere lost in time, “a city as if not of this world,” as Pasternak puts it?

It is impossible not to be struck by how much the city has changed since I had last seen it, maybe four years ago. Gabriadze has a renovated theater, which opened in 2010. He designed it with the same cockeyed whimsy he puts into the puppets he makes. A crooked clock tower, encrusted with Gabriadze’s handmade tiles, sprouts a pomegranate tree from its roof. A gold-winged angel strikes the hours.

The changes go well beyond the theater. The whole surrounding neighborhood, what the history books used to call Old Tiflis, looks freshly minted. The houses wear bright new paint, and their sagging balconies have somehow pulled themselves up straight. The streets are clean, or at least much cleaner, and there are scores of new cafes and restaurants.

This was the first time I’d had a chance to see the Peace Bridge over the Kura river — it opened in 2010. The Italian architect Michele De Lucchi gave the bridge a wavy glass roof lit by more than 1,200 LEDs for maximum twinkle.

Just down from Freedom Square at the city’s heart stands a boxy block of glass shaded by huge droopy white petals on tubular stems. It’s the new Tbilisi Public Service Hall by two other Italians, Massimiliano and Doriana Fuksas, and if it seems overscaled, it’s meant to. Inside the cavernous hall, Georgians are getting married, buying new houses, paying their taxes and conducting all manner of official business with an absence of humiliation and indignity that is quite fresh here. The grandiose architecture is meant to amplify the virtues of Georgia’s kinder, gentler bureaucracy. “I’m done in five minutes, which is almost a shame because it’s so pleasant here I don’t want to leave,” one of my Georgian friends tells me.

Do not expect rousing applause for any of this, however. For all their charm, Georgians can be maddeningly querulous. Tbilisi’s face-lift has gotten many of them particularly riled up. The complaints come in a variety of voices, some shrill and some shriller. The preservationists accuse the government of handing out inducements to private developers, who favored slapdash commercialism over historical authenticity in restoring Old Tbilisi. The local artist Gio Sumbadze calls it “facadism.”

Sumbadze does have a point. There is indeed a Ye Olde quality to some of the jazzed-up facades. But in fairness, the government needed to make some concessions to induce private developers; it could never have afforded to restore Old Tbilisi on its own. Meanwhile, the Soviets had crammed four or five families into houses built for one, and the wear and tear was dismantling the area from the inside.

I take a walk around the historic district with Maia Mania, a professor at Tbilisi’s State Academy of Art and one of the new Old Tbilisi’s fiercest adversaries. “Look at that!” she says, pointing a withering finger at one old building. “They took out the old bricks there and used brick cladding! And they attached a balcony there — what for?” Finally we come upon a lovely open courtyard, a characteristic feature of traditional Georgian houses. Mania finds it quite harmonious, except for “those three red things. I wish they weren’t there.” They are two women in red sweaters and a red car. “I am ill with what they have done in Old Tbilisi,” she says, looking genuinely ill. “If they had done a real restoration on 10 houses, I would be silent.”

More than a few Tbilisians find the new buildings incongruous and jarring, and sometimes just plain bad. The Peace Bridge, a source of much raillery, is nicknamed the Always Ultra Bridge for its resemblance to a feminine napkin. “I think the new buildings would be marvelous, but maybe someplace far away, like in the suburbs,” says Nino Sukhishvili, who, along with her brother, runs the Georgian National Ballet founded by her grandparents.

No local animus quite matches that of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the quirky billionaire who entered public life expressly to topple former President Mikheil Saakashvili, the man behind Tbilisi’s architectural revival. Ivanishvili, now Georgia’s prime minister, has made no secret of his disdain for Tbilisi’s new buildings, sucking them into a wider Kulturkampf over Georgia’s identity. He has called them a waste and an eyesore.

Saakashvili was swept into power by the Rose Revolution in 2003. He was young and dashing, and so were the good-looking men and women who joined his government. They enjoyed overwhelming popularity and good will. Like Russia’s Peter the Great, Saakashvili set out to usher in a golden age of Western-leaning modernity, using Italian architects to fashion the iconography.

The goal was a worthy one for a country mired in post-Soviet poverty and corruption. The problem was that Saakashvili pursued it more like a czar than an elected president. Dissent was ignored or overridden, sometimes brutally, and the Rose Revolution withered under his harsh care. By October 2012, Georgia had finally had enough, and booted out Saakashvili’s United National Movement at the polls. (His own term as president ended in October 2013.)

Ivanishvili has been the opposite of gracious in victory. He often seems driven more by an implacable hatred of Saakashvili and all his works than by any particular vision of his own. He has brought various charges against more than 100 United National Movement politicians, and even put some of them behind bars while they awaited trial. And he has effectively stamped out any architectural renaissance in Tbilisi, old and new.

On the riverbank across from the Old Town, bulldozers sit idle on the site of a controversial music theater and exhibition hall, also designed by the Fuksases. It was to be housed in a pair of massive pipes that now lie there like two Ozymandian legs of steel. Most people I spoke to never liked them anyway, and they do look ungainly and strange where they are.

But that’s not the point, or at least it wasn’t Ivanishvili’s point when the theater’s Georgian developer was detained last November on suspicion of receiving illegal funds. Shortly after, Tbilisi’s mayor, Gigi Ugulava, released a statement: “The Prime Minister sees the building of the theater as the muzzle of a cannon directed at his residence and is threatening to destroy it. There is no point arguing about tastes, but I am getting the impression that people are being detained for their taste in Georgia now.”

I meet Ugulava in his office in one of Tbilisi’s new high-rises. At 38, he is one of Saakashvili’s eager young Rose Revolutionaries. He tells me: “When Ivanishvili says he wants to destroy the theater or the Peace Bridge, it has nothing to do with architecture; it has to do with his wish to get rid of everything from Saakashvili’s era. Besides, look at Ivanishvili’s own home. It was the first big modern glass building in Tbilisi.”

You can’t miss it if you look up on the hill above Tbilisi: a $50 million futuristic thingy that looks like it’s waiting for George Jetson to land on its helipad. Ivanishvili, often described as a recluse, likes to work up there instead of in his offices in Tbilisi. The complex also houses his private zoo, not to mention artwork by Hirst and Koons down through Lucian Freud, Lichtenstein and Henry Moore (Actually, the paintings in Tbilisi are copies; Ivanishvili keeps the originals in London.) At $6 billion, Ivanishvili’s fortune, made in Russia during the rough-and-tumble days of privatization, comes to around half of Georgia’s G.D.P.

Georgians know better than most people that power comes and goes. They’ve had a lot of practice recycling imperial debris. Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi’s main artery, is lined with the elephant skeletons of Russian and Soviet dominion. Temur Ugulava is currently transforming one of them, a gargantuan Soviet printing house from the 1970s, into two luxury hotels. He will keep all the old printing machinery, which churned out copies of Pravda in another lifetime. “Temur prefers to buy Soviet buildings,” says Natalia Kancheli, who is working with Ugulava on the project. The two of them recently converted an old Soviet hotel near Mount Kazbegi in the Caucasus mountains. “Cost was no object to the Soviets. These buildings will withstand a 9.0 earthquake.”

Ultimately, however, there’s a lot more at stake here than architecture. Farther down Rustaveli Avenue is the old parliament building, near where I meet Giga Bokeria, another ministerial survivor from the Rose Revolution. The parliament is a Soviet classic from 1938, with a colonnade of elongated arches rising up four soul-crushing stories. It’s no longer used. Saakashvili moved parliament to a utopian complex he had constructed in Kutaisi, three hours away, by the Spanish architect Alberto Domingo. The new parliament is a big glass egg that looks intended to support human life on an inhospitable planet.

Which, in a sense, it is. “All these new buildings were part of a package. We were trying to change the mentality of the whole apparatus,” Bokeria says. “In post-Soviet times, the government had an orgasm just finding ways to insult you. That’s what we were trying to leave behind. The core of the debate was always, What kind of country should Georgia be?”

Lately, that debate has grown sharper teeth. Last May, gay rights demonstrators were badly beaten during a rally that had been condemned beforehand by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Ivanishvili denounced the violence, but the antimodern sentiment isn’t just aimed at buildings anymore. “That was the most shameful day in our history,” Bokeria says. “They’re trying to make us un-Georgian.”

“I believe there’s a tipping point for everything,” Kancheli says. “Saakashvili finally reached it, and now he’s gone. I think Ivanishvili’s government will ultimately reach a point on the other extreme, and then they’ll be gone too. Hopefully, one day Georgians will learn how to live in the middle.” Whichever way Georgia swings, a building somewhere in Tbilisi will commemorate it.",The historic city&#8217;s shiny new skyline is a source of both aesthetic and political controversy.,159.375,0.8125,1.3125,high,medium,abstractive,architecture

Among the executives named at Microsoft in the reorganization of the company are, from left; Julie Larson-Green, Terry Myerson, Qi Lu, Satya Nadella and Tony Bates.

SEATTLE â A couple of years ago, a satirical set of diagrams depicting the organization of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and other technology companies made the rounds on the Internet. The chart for Microsoft showed several isolated pyramids representing its divisions, each with a cartoon pistol aimed at the other.

Its divisions will war no more, Microsoft said on Thursday.

The company said it would dissolve its eight product divisions in favor of four new ones arranged around broader functional themes, a change meant to encourage a tighter marriage among technologies as competitors like Apple and Google outflank it in the mobile and Internet markets.

âTo execute, weâve got to move from multiple Microsofts to one Microsoft,â Steven A. Ballmer, the longtime chief executive, said in an interview.

The notion of organizing the company around the trinity of modern technology products â software, hardware and services â is most famously used by Apple. It is yet another sign of how deeply Appleâs way of doing things has seeped into every pore of the technology industry.

And in the process, some of the biggest technology companies are starting to look much more alike organizationally. The goal is to get thousands of employees to collaborate more closely, to avoid some duplication and, as a result, to build their products to work more harmoniously together.

âThe current model is obviously Apple, given how phenomenally successful they have been,â said Kevin Werbach, an associate professor of business at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. âWhat Apple has been great at is creating these experiences.â

The changes at Microsoft, a giant in the tech industry for decades that has stalled in the last few years, echo similar moves at its biggest rivals, including some tweaking at Apple. Craig Federighi, who led the development of Appleâs operating system for computers, was also given oversight of much of the operating system for iPhones and iPads. Jonathan Ive, the industrial designer behind the slick look of Apple hardware, took charge of the interface of Apple software. At Google, the development of operating systems for mobile devices and computers was put into the hands of a single executive, Sundar Pichai, rather than two.

Microsoft said on Thursday that it, too, would consolidate its major operating systems, including Windows, Windows Phone and the software that powers the Xbox, under Terry Myerson, who handled engineering only for Windows Phone before. The underlying goal is to create software with tighter linkages to power an array of devices, making it easier for people to use their smartphones, tablets and game consoles as adjuncts to one another.

But Microsoftâs charges are far more sweeping and involve many more people. âThis is, in my mind, the biggest thing weâve ever done,â said Lisa Brummel, a 24-year Microsoft veteran who leads its human resources department, noting that the company has nearly 100,000 employees.

It remains to be seen whether more cohesive teamwork, if that is what results from all the movement, will offer the spark that has been missing recently from so many of Microsoftâs products. The company remains one of the most lucrative enterprises on the planet, with nearly $17 billion in profit during its last fiscal year on $73.7 billion in revenue. But it has been widely faulted for being late with compelling products in two lucrative categories, smartphones and tablets. Its Bing search engine is a distant second to Google and loses billions of dollars a year for Microsoft.

Rivalries among the Microsoft divisions have built up over time, sometimes resulting in needless duplication of efforts. Microsoft managers often grumble privately that one of the most dreaded circumstances at the company is having to âtake a dependencyâ on another group for a piece of software, placing them at the mercy of someone elseâs development schedule.

Product development groups will sometimes go to great lengths to avoid this, creating software like e-mail programs that duplicate the functions of other products at Microsoft. While its old divisions all had their own finance and marketing organizations, Microsoft is now centralizing those functions.

The Gorham Company was on the southwest corner of Fifth and 36th.

The strip of Fifth Avenue from 34th to 40th Street once formed a royal row of retail, with the jewelry and silver palaces of Gorham and Tiffany at 36th and 37th Streets sharing the throne.

But this section of Fifth went off the gold standard long ago. Both businesses lighted out for uptown, and the lower floors of both were mutilated. The restoration of Tiffany in 2002 shows the limits of good intentions.

The Gorham Company was founded in 1831, Tiffany & Company in 1837, and by the Civil War era, both were at the forefront of the jewelry and silver business. According to the historian Christopher Monkhouse, a curator at the Art Institute of Chicago, they began a running competition in 1873 to make the best silver object, which he calls the âbattle of the punch bowls.â

Nevertheless, by 1903, when both filed plans for new buildings within a block of each other, there was apparently no competition, no race to open or outdo, and both were working with McKim, Mead & White. Both opened in 1905, Tiffany a deeply modeled screen of marble columns similar to the Palazzo Grimani in Venice, Gorham a more chaste Renaissance palazzo of limestone, with a sumptuous cornice and ground-floor arcade with sculptured panels and a bronze frieze.

The first purchase at Gorham is not known, but that at Tiffany was for $10,000. The firm kept $1 million in its safe at night, and had a wagon lift to the basement so that precious goods were not handed across the sidewalk. The interiors were sumptuous. Tiffany had a grand coffered ceiling and columns of silvery gray marble from the Urals, and Gorham a ceiling of broad, shallow arches, covered with decorative relief.

In 1905 Architecture Magazine described Tiffany as one of the finest store buildings in America, and in a 1908 issue of The California Architect and Engineer, the French critic Augustin-Adolphe Rey called the Gorham structure âthe most beautiful business building in the world.â

However, in June 1904, as the buildings were nearing completion, the architect Charles P. H. Gilbert complained to The Real Estate Record and Guide about them in the context of Fifth Avenue, saying that the landscape of wildly varying designs was discordant and undesirable.

Gilbert retracted his remarks within the week, having decided that the two buildings were âornaments on Fifth Avenue.â Certainly he was conscious that Edward Holbrook, the head of Gorham, was also an active property developer, having done two town houses for him already. But Gilbert never worked for Holbrook again â at least, not in Manhattan.

Perhaps Gorham and Tiffany saw themselves as allies instead of competitors, united in fighting the common enemy of theft. In 1909 a clerk at a Havana hotel posed as the manager and flimflammed both stores out of more than a thousand dollars and a few gems, baiting them with a promise of a huge order. He escaped by ocean liner.

By the 1940s both companies had relocated, and their old neighborhood was sliding downhill. In 1951 the owner of the Tiffany building ripped out much of the ground floor, provoking Lewis Mumford to use his column in The New Yorker to call for the creation of a âSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Buildings.â

Then in 1960 the owner of the Gorham building stripped away columns, carvings and the rest of the lower facade in favor of a grid of aluminum and glass.

The pendulum of architectural taste has a wide swing, and in 2000 the Schwalbe family, owners of the Gorham building, announced plans to recreate the missing ground floor with a trompe lâoeil mural on the front, something preservationists viewed with suspicion, preferring a true restoration.

The Schwalbes never went ahead, but in 2002 the architects Beyer Blinder Belle recreated the ground floor of the Tiffany building, removing the jumbled storefronts that had taken over, and scrupulously rebuilding the giant marble pilasters on the front, which had been cut off at the bottom.

But high-mindedness goes only so far. The curtailmentÂ of the blaring storefronts at Tiffany was like a blast of air-conditioningÂ in a hot attic, but the recreation of the lowerÂ 20 feetÂ ofÂ marble did not work out so well, and the bright new material at the bottomÂ suggests a pair of khakis dipped in bleach.

The Gorham building is made of granite and limestone, bothÂ much easier to match than marble, butÂ replacing the intricate carving would be costly. And while the Tiffany facade is deeply modeled, that of the Gorham is flat, and depended heavily on the luxurious bronze storefront, an expensive proposition to replicate.

The Schwalbe family is working with the architect Arthur Kahane on various repairs, and he says he has prepared drawings for an actual Gorham restoration. Mr. Kahane proposes using cast stone instead of granite and limestone, which would be met cautiously by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. He wonât say what it would cost, but the estimate 13 years ago was $7 million. Still, Mr. Kahane said, âthis client is concerned about aesthetics; if anybody is going to do it, they would.â",Time was when Tiffany and Gorham sold treasures out of sumptuous stores in Murray Hill.,62.0625,0.6875,0.9375,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Each floor in the building â not including the ground floor â was divided into only one or two lofts, but over the years the main entrance has shifted to the 13th Street side at No. 405.

In the earlier years, parties raged around the clock, with ad hoc performances by residents like the dot-obsessed Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama; the neo-Dada Frenchman Jean Dupuy, who also organized several on-site exhibitions; the Oldenburgs and Mr. Rivers; and visitors like Philip Glass, Charlotte Moorman, Gordon Matta-Clark and Laurie Anderson.

Ms. Kusama, the subject of a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art last year, learned a lot about Day-Glo colors from a fellow resident, Herb Aach, a painter who had also been high up at the Sargent Art crayon company.

âLarry was the king of all that,â Mr. Burckhardt said of Mr. Rivers. âNowadays itâs quieter. But the people here have always been creative, which gives it energy.â

As Mr. Burckhardt, who has lived in the building since 1995, heard stories about its past and made discoveries, he felt someone should remedy the buildingâs obscurity. He has organized an exhibition, â404 E 14,â which opens at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery on Thursday, and will include paintings, sculptures, photographs, correspondence, poetry and various ephemera.

Recently, seated at his dining table surrounded by some selections for the show, Mr. Burckhardt marveled at the idea that before Mr. Rivers and his wife, Clarice, could move into the top floor, they âhad to get rid of squatters.â Mr. Anderson, who owns the space now, paid $1.8 million for it a decade ago, and edited his last movie, âMoonrise Kingdom,â there.

The person who first opened up the building to residential use was Jack Klein, a real estate impresario at the forefront of downtown loft conversions. In the mid-1960s, he negotiated leases with the buildingâs owner, Bloom & Krup, a housewares retailer that was using it as a warehouse, and subleased lofts at low rents to eager artists.

The 1920s industrial pile, an anomaly among the neighborhoodâs tenements, was presented to its new tenants as a former button factory, and Mr. Burckhardt figured that âpeople from the neighborhood had worked here.â But the discovery of a single, upended piano in the space Mr. Wilson now shares with Mr. Lovell made some think that pianos had been manufactured there. The couple kept the instrument.

Ms. Mucha, who was married to Mr. Oldenburg from 1960 until 1970, said the fifth floor, which they took over, wasnât just raw but âcrude.â

âThere were pigeons flying through broken windows and such,â she said. âWe put metal-embossed ceilings up to keep out the dust, and we had an 18-foot bathroom.â (The bathroom is featured in a full-page photograph of Mr. Oldenburgâs shaving in the catalog accompanying âClaes Oldenburg: The Street and the Store,â currently at the Museum of Modern Art.)

In the back, they put Mr. Oldenburgâs studio, where his famous soft sculptures evolved.

Mr. Oldenburg lived and worked in the building until 1969. âIt was the first really big studio I had,â he said, âwhich was important because I could do so much with that.â

To sew the soft sculptures â Ms. Muchaâs task, on an industrial sewing machine â the pair had a very long table, which doubled for entertaining.

Because of the buildingâs thin floors, noise carried everywhere. So when, say, Ultra Violet, the Andy Warhol âsuperstar,â showed up at the sculptor John Chamberlainâs loft for a nighttime rehearsal with her band, Mr. Oldenburg said he and his wife would have to move from one of several bedroom spaces to another in order to sleep.

It didnât help living underneath Mr. Riversâs notorious all-night bacchanals, either â except to go to them.

Mr. Lovell remembered that one night, soon after he moved in in 1981, he heard âa weird sound upstairs. And Fred said, âOh, thatâs just someone roller-skating.âÂ â

Mr. Wilson added, âYou werenât here for the Brazilian soccer team.â He arrived in the building in 1976.","Over the course of almost five decades, 404 East 14th Street in Manhattan has been home to a remarkable collection of artists â among them Claes Oldenburg, Larry Rivers and the filmmaker Wes Anderson.",23.5135135135,0.9189189189,9.7837837838,medium,medium,extractive,architecture

There can be warm, fuzzy elements amid the concrete and scrap metal. Even a teddy bear can find its way in. Perhaps thereâs just something appealing about the juxtaposition of soft, fluffy animals and heavy-metal loaders, which feature in two new picture books this season. In both âConstruction Kitties,â by Judy Sue Goodwin Sturges, with illustrations by Shari Halpern, and âDig, Dogs, Dig,â by James Horvath, a crew of smiling pets get to work building â what else? â a playground.

In âConstruction Kitties,â the simpler of the two books, a team of cats makes its way in trucks through simple text and blocky, vibrant backgrounds to a deep-dirt construction site. âOnto the long, winding highway. Construction Kitties purr and sing to the music.â

The colors are bold, the goodwill ample, the task simple and fun. Everything here is tailored for the very young, dump truck-obsessed reader, with short sentences that can be read aloud with gusto. There are lots of cheery exclamation points as the cats start the job. âWeâre here! On with our hats! Letâs get to work!â It all ends on monkey rings and in the sandbox.

âDig, Dogs, Dig,â a more ambitious book, introduces a series-bound cast of dogs â Duke, Roxy, Buddy, Max, etc. (and one cat, Jinx). It is written and illustrated by James Horvath, whose background in cartoons and comic books is much in evidence here. With its punchy rhymes and Hanna-Barbera panoramas, âDig, Dogs, Digâ hops along with the bouncy effervescence of P.D. Eastmanâs âGo Dog. Go!,â whose title Horvath seems deliberately to evoke.

Everyone is in a hurry! âEat some breakfast on the go. Quickly, now. Youâre moving too slow,â are exhortations that will resonate with any family who struggle to rally for school in the morning. If only they could head out to a construction site instead! The dogs are all smiles and hum with purpose. Many sport wide-open grins like airborne Jetsons.

Horvath knows the desire for specificity that drives the truck lover, and duly names his vehicles and details their respective functions.Â âThe loader picks up a rocky big bite/and moves out the rubble with all its might.â Each page bustles with comic detail â Buddy surfing on the front end of a loader as it swerves through town, Jinx hidden in a Styrofoam-packed box, a puppy panting in jogging stroller. The action moves along swiftly, and even encounters a surprise dinosaur bone, which becomes the centerpiece of the grand finale â a new playground complete with duck pond and fountain.

For these two rousing books, unlike âGoodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site,â the goal isnât just bedtime. The beauty of building a playground is that thereâs ample opportunity for play when youâre all done.",Crews of smiling pets get to work in two new picture books.,44.5384615385,0.9230769231,4.7692307692,high,medium,mixed,architecture

He was 93.

His death, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was announced by Charlotte Parker, his longtime publicist.

Mr. Weider may not have been the 97-pound weakling of the comic books who got tired of having sand kicked in his face. But as a teenager in Montreal, he hated being roughed up by neighborhood hooligans, discovered bodybuilding in a magazine and bought into it for life. He developed a V-shaped torso with bulging biceps and abs like Michelangelo’s David, and he was still muscular and jut-jawed in his 70s and 80s.

In the intervening decades, Mr. Weider (pronounced WEE-dur), who moved to the United States as a young man, founded many of the world’s most popular bodybuilding magazines, including Muscle and Fitness, Flex, Men’s Fitness and, for women, Shape. They had 25 million readers at their peak and were crammed with photos of greased bodybuilders and Hollywood stars like Sylvester Stallone, Cher and Mr. Schwarzenegger.

Riding waves of postwar fascination with bodybuilding, Mr. Weider and his brother Ben founded the International Federation of Body Builders, which sponsored the Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia contests and other competitions for men and women featuring gibbous thighs and sugar-loaf pectorals. Ben Weider, who was the federation’s president from 1946 to 2006, established affiliates in some 170 countries.

With Joe Weider focusing on publications and products, the brothers promoted fitness as a lifestyle and bodybuilding as an international sport with Olympic aspirations (distinct from weight lifting), and sought to combat popular images of bodybuilders as muscle-bound oddballs.

In 1968, Mr. Weider recruited Mr. Schwarzenegger, an Austrian bodybuilding champion, moved him to Los Angeles and gave him $100 a week to write articles for his magazines that endorsed Weider products. Mr. Schwarzenegger also repeatedly won Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia titles. There were complaints that Weider athletes won his federation’s contests with suspicious regularity, but no proof of fixes was forthcoming.

Mr. Schwarzenegger said Mr. Weider was a constant through every stage of his career.

“He advised me on my training, on my business ventures, and once, bizarrely, claimed I was a German Shakespearean actor to get me my first acting role in ‘Hercules in New York,’ even though I barely spoke English,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said in a statement. “He was there for me constantly throughout my life, and I will miss him dearly.”

Mr. Weider had a knack for pseudoscientific, muscular-sounding names. He became “the Master Blaster” and developed fitness equipment like the Solid Steel Tricep Bomber and food supplements like Dynamic Muscle Builder protein powder, Carbo Energizer Chewables, Performance Foods and Anabolic Mega-Paks, which featured an ingredient that he said had been scraped from the floor of the Pacific.

“Nowadays, people want what a professional athlete would eat,” Mr. Weider told The New York Times in 1989. “So we developed these booster pancakes that give you extra amino acids, which are important in protein synthesis and the building of muscle tissue.”

He looked like the King of Bodybuilders, even in his later years. He had a Los Angeles tan that set off a mane of silver hair, a rakish silver mustache and the physique of a narcissistic gladiator. In photos that lined his office, he fit right in with his iron-pumping protégés like Mr. Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno, television’s Incredible Hulk.

Mr. Weider sold his equipment and dietary supplements through advertisements and feature articles that were unapologetically juxtaposed in his cataloglike magazines, which featured exotic pieces like “Bulgarian Leg Training Secrets.” The magazines circulated to millions around the world, many of whom were not fitness fanatics but just wanted to get in better shape.

While Mr. Weider began as a mail-order entrepreneur, his company by the 1980s was marketing his equipment in 6,000 retail outlets and nutritional products in 12,000 stores in the United States alone. By the 1990s, he was selling in at least 60 countries and grossing hundreds of millions of dollars annually for Weider America’s Total Fitness Company, based in Los Angeles.","Mr. Weider, who was a mentor to Arnold Schwarzenegger, created a world of muscle magazines, fitness equipment and dietary supplements, helping popularize the sport.",28.8965517241,0.8965517241000001,2.6206896552,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

The Pacific branch of the Brooklyn Public Library would be rebuilt at no public expense on an apartment towerâs ground floor.

The Brooklyn Heights library is neither the oldest nor the most dilapidated branch of the Brooklyn Public Library system. But the 52-year-old limestone building is nonetheless ripe for demolition.

Air-conditioning failures closed the Brooklyn Heights library for 30 days last summer; replacing the system would cost $3 million.

It sits on land that developers crave, in a fashionable neighborhood where housing is in high demand. And so the library system, desperate for money to pay for $230 million in long-deferred repairs for its 60 branches, has embraced a novel financing model that is increasingly being used around New York City as a way to pay for government services.

The library, on Cadman Plaza, along with another library near the Barclays Center, would be sold to developers, torn down and then rebuilt at no public expense on the ground floor of a new apartment tower.

Government-financed agencies, seeing a way to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in a weak economy, are looking at the land right under some of their own institutions and offering it to the best bidder, who will build new, modern libraries or schools in the base of new developments. In the process, they will also erase the stout civic buildings now there, in effect leveling public facilities to make sure the agencies are financially secure.

The strategy has been embraced in Brooklyn, where the two libraries need repairs of $9 million to $11 million.

“We would deliver two of these libraries for essentially no cost to the library system,” said Joshua Nachowitz, the Brooklyn Public Library’s vice president for government and community relations. “It’s a win-win.”

But the approach has provoked growing protest in the affected communities. Most pressingly, residents are concerned about how far they will have to go to reach a library, and where their children will go to school, during the years it will take to erect the new towers. But they are also worried about the aesthetic and cultural price of replacing local institutions to which they are deeply attached, neighborhood landmarks if not official ones, and having them swallowed up into stacks of concrete, steel and glass.

“What makes a place interesting is different kinds of architecture and a school looking like a school,” said Laurie Frey, a member of the Community Education Council in District 3, a board that represents public school parents on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. “There’s a feeling of, ‘Oh please, not another high rise,’ and a feeling that, since we’re already getting used to an increased density in our few blocks, do we really need more?”

The city’s Educational Construction Fund is reviewing proposals for construction of high-rise apartment towers on the sites of two public schools near Lincoln Center — P.S. 191 on West 61st Street and P.S. 199 on West 70th Street, which was designed by the modernist architect Edward Durell Stone — and another school on East 96th Street, the School of Cooperative Technical Education. In each case, new schools would occupy the lower floors of the new buildings.

Officials have mingled private development and schools before; the new High School of Art and Design on East 56th Street is a prime exhibit. But the pace is accelerating. Three projects have been executed since 2008, and the latest proposal would sweep up three schools at once.

“We anticipate that we will be able to bring this successful model to other high-density zoning areas of the city,” said Erin Hughes, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, pointing to the success the department has had creating new classrooms on the Upper East Side.

Ms. Frey said she worried that “kicking students out of their home school is not a gentle process” and that “there will be an immediate negative impact on learning.” At a meeting last month, she said, an official of the Educational Construction Fund said that students from P.S. 191 would be moved to the Beacon High School building while the school was demolished and rebuilt, but that a relocation site for P.S. 199 had not yet been identified.","Starved for cash, some agencies are offering their desirable land to the best bidder, who will build new, modern libraries or schools in the base of new developments.",25.75,0.9062500000000001,14.09375,medium,medium,extractive,architecture

In a telephone interview Mr. Ito, 71, said he was gratified by the honor, especially because it represents an acceptance of his position as an iconoclast who has challenged the past 100 years of Modernism.

“I’ve been thinking that Modernism has already reached to the limit or a dead end,” Mr. Ito said through an interpreter. “I didn’t expect this surprising news, and I’m very happy about it.”

Nicolai Ouroussoff, then the architecture critic of The New York Times, remarked in 2009 that Mr. Ito had repeatedly been passed over for the Pritzker “in favor of designers with much thinner résumés.”

Mr. Ito will receive the award at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston on May 29.

Looking back over his career Mr. Ito said he is particularly proud of the Sendai Mediatheque, his library completed in Sendai, Japan, in 2001. The building’s design is dominated by structural tubes that support the floor plates and provide circulation, pathways that the Pritzker jury said “permitted new interior spatial qualities.”

But Mr. Ito is also proud of the building’s significance as a project that was meant to withstand an earthquake. (It won a Golden Lion Award at the 2012 Venice Architecture Biennale.) A video of the inside of the building taken by someone under a table during the earthquake in 2011 went viral.

“The building shook and swayed violently; everything cascaded from shelves and desks onto the floor,” the architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable wrote in The Wall Street Journal. “Ceiling panels appeared to swing drunkenly overhead. But the Mediatheque did not collapse. It stood firm against the massive seismic forces that were tearing other buildings apart; the basic structure did not fail.”

Mr. Ito has been active in the recovery effort. He recruited three young architects to help him develop the concept of Home-for-All, communal space for survivors. In his book “Toyo Ito: Forces of Nature,” edited by Jesse Turnbull and published last year by Princeton Architectural Press, Mr. Ito writes, “An architect is someone who can make such places for meager meals show a little more humanity, make them a little more beautiful, a little more comfortable.”

The citation said Mr. Ito consistently couples his personal creative agenda with a sense of public responsibility. “It is far more complex and riskier to innovate while working on buildings where the public is concerned,” the jury said, “but this has not deterred him.”

Though perhaps not as well known as architects like Rem Koolhaas or Frank Gehry, Mr. Ito rose to prominence with the completion of his stadium in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, built for the World Games in 2009.

And he has received his share of awards, including, in 2010, the Praemium Imperiale, which recognizes lifetime achievement in areas of the arts not covered by the Nobel Prizes.

But Mr. Ito said he doesn’t worry about status or architecture competitions. “We cannot predict what we will win or we won’t win,” he said.

He said he just needs to be able to do the work he wants to do. These days that includes flatware, called Mu, introduced in Paris by the Italian company Alessi. Mu means hexagon in Japanese and refers to the six-sided shape of the handles, which resemble chopsticks. The pattern complements Ku, the porcelain service Mr. Ito created for Alessi in 2006.

He has also been drawn to practical retail projects like a building for Tod’s, the Italian shoe and handbag company, and the facade of the Mikimoto Ginza 2 flagship store — both in Tokyo. And he continues to design ambitious public projects like the Taichung opera house, whose porous exterior has been likened to a gigantic sponge, and the Tama Art University Library, an irregular grid of concrete arches.

Born to Japanese parents in Keijo — now Seoul — in 1941, Mr. Ito moved to Tokyo in junior high school and then attended the University of Tokyo, where architecture became his main interest. He went on to graduate in 1965 and began working at the firm of Kiyonori Kikutake & Associates. In 1971 he left to start his own studio, calling it Urban Robot (Urbot), which in 1979 became Toyo Ito & Associates, Architects.

Many of his early works were residences — including one in a Tokyo suburb called “Aluminum House,” which consisted of a wooden frame completely covered in aluminum, and a home for his sister called “White U,” which generated considerable interest in his work.

Throughout his career, Mr. Ito said, he has tried to establish a connection between inside and the outside conditions, an effort evident in his lightweight structures that use materials like mesh, perforated aluminum and permeable fabrics.

That fluidity pervades projects like his World Games stadium, critics said, which do not conform to conventional definitions of modern architecture.

“It reflects his longstanding belief that architecture, to be human, must somehow embrace seemingly contradictory values,” Mr. Ouroussoff wrote in his review of the building. “Instead of a self-contained utopia, he offers us multiple worlds, drifting in and out of focus like a dream.”","Toyo Ito, who designed a library that survived Japanâs disastrous 2011 earthquake, has won his fieldâs top honor.",50.6666666667,0.7142857143,0.9047619048000001,high,low,abstractive,architecture

But if you’re more of a Yankee at heart, then a winter walk along Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx might just be your scene. On summer weekends, thousands of visitors flock here; in the cold weather, you would be lucky to see a few hardy souls enjoying the crescent beach and unpeopled views of City Island, Pelham Bay and Long Island Sound.

As natural as the beach seems, it’s a beauty built on artifice. In winter 1934, Robert Moses, then parks commissioner, brought Gilmore D. Clarke and Aymar Embury II, who were the department’s consulting landscape architect and architect, out in his Packard to see what they could make of the place. At the time, the beach was just a sandbar between a cluster of islands to the north and Rodman’s Neck. In just two years, they used landfill to build 115 new acres for the park and created the 1.1-mile-long beach that exists today.

The bathhouse pavilion that Embury designed was completed in 1937, the year after Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia celebrated the opening of Orchard Beach with 10,000 New Yorkers and a lot of fireworks. The colonnaded structure has two wings embracing a central plaza and once housed restaurants, shops, showers and changing rooms. Now crumbling, it is off limits to visitors, but one can admire its monumental proportions and the Greek key design, set in sea blue tiles, embellishing the roofline frieze.

Pelham Bay Park comprises 2,765 acres; that’s more than three times the size of Central Park. In the 1880s, after much debate, the city exercised its right of eminent domain and bought the land for the park from local estate owners. It was the fulfillment of a plan for naturalistic parks and parkways in the Bronx that Frederick Law Olmsted had advocated a decade earlier.

The Bartow-Pell Mansion, the last remaining estate house in the park, survives as a museum. It was built in the late 1830s for Robert Bartow, a New York book publisher and descendant of Thomas Pell, who in 1654 had acquired some 50,000 acres from the Siwanoy Indians and established the Manor of Pelham here. Inside, the house is decorated in elegant 1850s style, with schoolgirl embroidery, Duncan Phyfe furniture and Aaron Burr’s writing desk. (His first wife, Theodosia, was a Bartow.) Outside, there’s a huge walled garden with a reflecting pool, and a view of the marshy lagoon, some of it dredged for the 1964 Olympic rowing trials.

Today, the lagoon is most valued for its wildlife, including many birds whose easy flight to the park you may envy. Though a commuter train used to stop at Bartow station, and there was once a monorail to City Island (it tipped over on its first run), these days the best way to get here is to take the subway and a local bus — or travel the Robert Moses way, along his scenic parkways in your very own automobile.",Among the highlights of Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx are Orchard Beach and the Bartow-Pell Mansion.,29.3,0.85,2.75,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

Oliver Luckett, center, with Jeff Pressman, left, and Kate McLean of theAudience. For its celebrity clients, the company aims to build armies of fans across the likes of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google Plus.

Raised in Mississippi and with the accent to prove it, Mr. Luckett, 38, is known for zooming around town in an Aston Martin — that is, when he’s not jetting off to places like Iceland, where he was last December to compete against Bjork in a gingerbread house-building contest. He lost, despite help from a buddy in Disneyland’s research and design lab.

With his new company — a social media start-up called theAudience — Mr. Luckett promises nothing short of rewiring celebrity economics, and he abruptly dismisses skeptics. “Get on my train,” he likes to say, his blue eyes blazing. “We’re leaving now.” Yet he can also be a big softy known for his striped-sock collection. During a business meeting not so long ago, he veered into an emotional story about coming out of the closet and started to weep.

Just another showy show-business personality? Some people think so. But many of the entertainment factory’s most powerful forces — William Morris Endeavor, Lionsgate, Universal Pictures — and one tech superstar, Sean Parker, are taking him very, very seriously.

About two years ago, Mr. Luckett left a senior position at Walt Disney, where he managed the social media presence of Cinderella and her cartoon friends, to do the same for actors and musicians. For each client, theAudience works to build a network of fans across the likes of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google Plus and to keep those followers engaged by posting a steady stream of catchy pictures, comments and videos.

THEAUDIENCE, part of a stampede of start-ups aiming to exploit the intersection of celebrity and social media, also sells its services directly to movie marketers, record labels and concert promoters. It did stealth work on behalf of the hit movie “Ted,” for instance, and the Coachella music festival. Mr. Luckett refuses to identify his clients, but he says theAudience publishes thousands of items a month on behalf of about 300 accounts, reaching a total of 800 million fans.

Movie and music executives say theAudience’s clients include Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Jack Black, Eddie Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Usher, Pitbull and LMFAO.

Celebrities seizing opportunities to promote themselves? As Captain Renault would say, “I’m shocked, shocked.” But theAudience illustrates something important about where Hollywood is headed. After largely ignoring social media — allowing fake Facebook pages to proliferate, sticking with tried-and-true publicity stops like “Entertainment Tonight” — stars and agents are realizing en masse that they need to get on that train.

There is intense downward pressure on artist salaries in all corners of entertainment. Movie attendance over the summer hit a 20-year low. The Web has decimated the music industry. DVRs are roiling television. William Morris Endeavor, a founding investor in theAudience, sees the assertive cultivation of social media networks as one way to shift power back to stars.

To agents, the metrics of theAudience offer crucial leverage: If you cast Ms. Theron in a movie, she comes with an ability to fill seats through her social network, and we can prove it with data. Oh, and she needs to be paid more because of that. The same leverage holds true for sealing endorsement deals, which is where celebrities, and their agency backers, increasingly make their real money.

“That is absolutely part of the conversation now,” says Ari Emanuel, the co-chief executive of William Morris Endeavor. “We all use all the tools we have.”

If you were wondering how Rihanna was cast in “Battleship,” it was lost on no one at Universal that she came with 26 million Twitter followers.

Ultimately, Mr. Emanuel and others look at social media networks as a new type of cable channel, and theAudience is helping celebrities to program theirs. Consider it as the Web equivalent of OWN, Oprah Winfrey’s channel; she maintains control of what goes on it, but she hires people to make it happen.

“The real value of these networks is in programming,” says Mr. Parker, the Napster founder who also played a big role in Facebook’s world domination. “If you can aggregate effectively, you can start to imagine social media a little bit more like traditional media.”

Mr. Luckett has a long history with start-ups, including Revver, a video sharing site that was precursor to YouTube. He says theAudience recently obtained $20 million in an additional round of financing from Guggenheim Partners; Intertainment Media; Participant Media; the Founders Fund, which is Mr. Parker’s investment company; and the Capricorn Investment Group, the investment arm of Jeffrey Skoll, the first president of eBay.

“A lot of celebrities are overwhelmed with the demands of social media, and theAudience, which has some extremely smart executives, is one of the companies filling the void,” said Danielle De Palma, senior vice president for digital marketing at Lionsgate, which hired Mr. Luckett to work on “The Hunger Games.”","Oliver Luckett and his social media start-up, theAudience, offer celebrities a chance to build armies of fans across the likes of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google Plus.",30.2647058824,0.9705882353,10.6764705882,medium,high,extractive,architecture

In a statement, Giorgio Napolitano, the president of Italy, referred to her as a “leading figure of contemporary architecture” with an “extraordinary ability” to combine cultural and historic values with the urban environment.

Ms. Aulenti was one of the few Italian women to rise to prominence in architecture and design in the postwar years. Her work includes villas for the rich, showrooms for Fiat, shops for Olivetti, pens and watches for Louis Vuitton, and a coffee table on wheels that is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Ms. Aulenti was best known for her work on interiors, particularly those of museums. She designed museum renovations in Venice, Barcelona, Istanbul and San Francisco.

In 1981 she was chosen to turn the 1900 Beaux Arts Gare d’Orsay train station, a spectacular landmark originally designed by Victor Laloux, into the Musée d’Orsay, a museum of mainly French art from 1848 to 1915.

As part of the redesign she created a grand central aisle in a cavernous space that once contained train tracks under a dramatic barrel-vaulted glass ceiling. Original support beams were highlighted, and new industrial materials like wire mesh were used. Walls were redone in rough stone.

The renovated building was opened in December 1986, and critical reaction was mixed. Holland Cotter of The New York Times called it “fabulously eccentric.” But Liberation, an Italian newspaper favored by the cognoscenti, said the museum had been “likened to a funeral hall, to a tomb, to a mausoleum, to an Egyptian burial monument, to a necropolis.”

Ms. Aulenti noted that almost immediately 20,000 people were standing in line each day waiting to get in. “As a culture, the French are opposed to change,” she said in an interview with The Times in 1987. “They are also not very progressive in their thinking about architecture, so that when new buildings are designed, they are usually opposed to them.”

Her champions saw the Paris museum as a giant step for someone whose influence had been as an industrial designer and as a leader of a young generation of Italian theorists who had questioned the tenets of modernist architecture. In 1999, Herbert Muschamp, then the architecture critic for The Times, called her “the most important female architect since the beginning of time.”

Less effusively, the architect Philip Johnson said, “Anyone who makes as strong a statement as Gae did is going to run into a buzz saw.”

Gaetana Aulenti (Gae, as she was known, is pronounced “guy”) was born on Dec. 4, 1927 in the town of Palazzolo dello Stella, near Trieste. She told The Times that she studied architecture in defiance of her parents’ hope that she would become “a nice society girl.” In 1954, she was one of two women in a class of 20 to graduate from the Milan Polytechnic School of Architecture. She soon joined the staff of Casabella, a design magazine, and joined with her peers in rejecting the architecture of masters like Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. They called themselves the “Neo Liberty” movement.

“More than anything, we were trying to recognize our own identity,” she said.

She taught architecture at universities in Milan and Venice and started doing interior design projects. She went on to become a celebrated furniture designer, some of her work borrowing from Pop Art. Lighting was another specialty, which she drew on in designing sets for opera houses throughout Europe. She planned six stores for the fashion designer Adrienne Vittadini, including one on Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles. (She even designed the mannequins.)

Her work on the Musée d’Orsay led to commissions to create a space for the National Museum of Modern Art at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris; the restoration of the Palazzo Grassi as an art museum in Venice; the conversion of an old Italian embassy in Berlin into an Academy of Science; and the restoration of an exhibition hall in Barcelona as a museum of Catalan art.

In San Francisco, she converted the city’s old Main Library into a museum of Asian art. As it neared completion in 2001, she lamented that her interior museum work drew less attention than the ballyhooed new museums being built, like Frank Gehry’s titanium-walled one for the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain. “The drama can’t be seen outside,” she told The San Francisco Chronicle.

Ms. Aulenti was divorced twice. She is survived by her daughter, Giovanna, and a granddaughter.

In her work in Paris, Ms. Aulenti said, she got her way with tough French construction crews by making them think of her as their mother “whom they must please.” She dressed conservatively, not out of indifference to fashion, she said, but defiance.

“I don’t like to dress alla moda,” she told Women’s Wear Daily in 1971, using the Italian term for in fashion. “The moment it’s loudly announced that red is fashion, I stop wearing red. I want to dress in green.”","Ms. Aulenti, one of the few Italian women to rise to prominence in architecture during the postwar years, was best known for her museum renovations and interior designs.",32.4516129032,0.9354838710000001,5.9677419355,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

Johansen, Last of âHarvard Fiveâ Architects, Dies at 96",1970-01-01 00:33:32.102819,"John M. Johansen, a celebrated Modernist architect and the last surviving member of the Harvard Five, a group that made New Canaan, Conn., a hotbed of architectural experimentation in the 1950s and ’60s, died on Friday in Brewster, Mass. He was 96.

The cause was heart failure, said his son, Christen.

In the postwar years Mr. Johansen and four other young Modernist architects — Philip Johnson, Marcel Breuer, Landis Gores and Eliot Noyes, all with connections to Harvard’s architecture school — dotted southwestern Connecticut with houses conveying the optimism of the time. Hugely influential in the field, the buildings were seen in museum exhibitions and on the covers of Life and Look magazines.

Some of the five, including Johnson, liked to strip houses down to their bare essentials. Mr. Johansen took a more varied approach. His Warner House (1957) in New Canaan, also known as the Villa Ponte, had a symmetrical layout derived from the Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio. Vaulted gold-leaf ceilings, terrazzo floors and ebonized-wood cabinets helped show that Modernism, which had its roots in industrial efficiency, could also be luxurious.

His Telephone Pole House (1968) in Greenwich, Conn., was made from 104 poles, which braced the structure into the side of a steep ravine. He created a series of cavelike dwellings by spraying concrete onto bulbous mesh armatures. His Plastic Tent House (1975) in Stanfordville, N.Y. — which he built as his own home — consisted of a steel frame covered in translucent plastic. Mr. Johansen lived there after leaving New Canaan in the ’70s and opening a practice in Manhattan. He later moved to Wellfleet, Mass., on Cape Cod.

Mr. Johansen also designed a number of large public buildings, among them, in the 1960s, the Goddard Library at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.; the Clowes Memorial Hall at Butler University in Indianapolis (with Evans Woollen); the Museum of Art, Science and Industry, now the Discovery Museum and Planetarium, in Bridgeport, Conn.; and the Orlando Public Library in Florida.

His Morris A. Mechanic Theater in Baltimore (1967) and the Mummers Theater in Oklahoma City (1970) — now the Stage Center — consist of concrete “pods” connected by walkways and tubes. With their raw concrete exteriors, they were easy targets for criticism. From 1973 to 1987 Mr. Johansen worked with Ashok Bhavnani, with whom he completed the Island House and Rivercross apartment buildings on Roosevelt Island in New York.

Mr. Johansen outlived some of his creations. Of the seven houses he designed in New Canaan, three were demolished and one, he said, was “remodeled beyond recognition.” In 1988 his Labyrinth House in Westport, made of rough-hewn concrete forms bracketing floor-to-ceiling glass — a kind of domesticated Stonehenge — was torn down by the television host Phil Donahue, who described it as “an avant-garde bomb shelter.” Its loss, Mr. Johansen said at the time, was like a death in the family.

Baltimore’s historic preservation commission recently rejected a plan to demolish the Mechanic Theater. The future of the Mummers Theater remains in doubt; the foundation that owns it is fighting preservation efforts. Mr. Johansen continued writing and lecturing well into his 90s. In 2002 he published “Nanoarchitecture: A New Species of Architecture,” a book filled with futuristic projects based on advances in biology and physics. He described it as “an exhortation to the younger generations.”

John MacLane Johansen was born at his home on West Ninth Street in Manhattan on June 29, 1916, the second of two children of John Christen Johansen and the former Jean MacLane. He was raised in Greenwich Village, where his parents were successful portrait painters.

As an aspiring architect, he assembled impeccable Modernist credentials, studying under Walter Gropius, the founder of Germany’s Bauhaus school, at Harvard (where he was a member of the varsity track team and captain of the soccer team), then working for Breuer (who designed the Whitney Museum of American Art building in Manhattan) and for the blue-chip firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. He later held teaching posts at the Pratt Institute in New York and Yale. In 1948 Mr. Johansen opened his own office in New Canaan, joining the other Modernists in what came to be seen as a five-man architectural movement.

Mr. Johansen’s first two marriages, to Mary Lee Longcope and Mary Ellen Goode, ended in divorce. He later married Ati Gropius, the daughter of his Harvard mentor. She survives him. Besides his son, Christen, he is also survived by a daughter, Deborah Harris, both from his first marriage; a stepdaughter, Erika Markou; three grandchildren; two step-grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.

In recent years Mr. Johansen refused to return to New Canaan, where he blamed real estate speculators for tearing down houses he had designed. But in an interview in 2005, he waxed philosophical.

“The reward,” he said, “is in the doing. Having built the houses, I’ve already won.""

The Jade Hotel, a boutique hotel with 113 rooms, under construction on West 13th Street.

In 2011, developers added 4,404 new hotel rooms to the city’s existing 74,025 rooms, an annual increase of 5.9 percent and the highest on record, according to Smith Travel Research and the commercial real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.

Supply is projected to increase by 3.5 percent in 2012 and 4.1 percent in 2013. From 2005 to 2010, hotel room supply grew by 16.2 percent, for an average of only 3.24 percent annually.

New hotels range from high-end boutiques in Greenwich Village and Chelsea to budget chains in less fashionable parts of Brooklyn and Queens. In addition to the new rooms, large existing hotels have undergone major renovations, including the former New York Helmsley Hotel which reopened earlier this month as the Westin Grand Central after a $75 million overhaul.

The hotel building boom has been buoyed by occupancy rates and revenues that have rebounded close to prerecession levels. Tourists and business travelers have filled up the new rooms, despite the European debt crisis and economic slowdown in Asia. The citywide occupancy rate fell to 77 percent in 2009 after the financial crisis, but it has rebounded to more than 80 percent in each of the last three years.

“Occupancy really has not dropped off through all this increase,” said Thomas P. McConnell, executive managing director of Cushman & Wakefield’s hotel transactions group.

Last year, tourism increased by 3.5 percent to a record 50.5 million visitors, according to NYC and Company, the city’s official tourism group. In fact, New York is the strongest of the largest 25 United States markets by occupancy, according to Smith Travel Research.

Total revenue also rebounded to $7.21 billion in 2011, after plunging 22.6 percent to $5.48 billion in 2009, according to Smith Travel Research.

“A lot of Fortune 1,000 companies have unspent capital. The easy way to deploy it is to put it into travel and training,” said Jan D. Freitag, executive vice president of Smith Travel Research. “It seems that there’s this unalienable right to travel.”

The strong fundamentals have encouraged new hotels in virtually every Manhattan neighborhood, with developers fighting to differentiate themselves through design, marketing or location.

One of the most popular new hotel types is the small, high-end boutique, like the 113-room Jade Hotel, which will open on West 13th Street in Greenwich Village at the end of October.

The Jade’s developer, William T. Obeid, president and chief executive of Gemini Real Estate Advisors, could have built a rental building on the site, but he saw continued strength in tourism and a lack of hotels in the area.

“I saw the fundamentals of the hospitality business begin to change in March 2010. We knew we had to reignite 13th Street,” said Mr. Obeid, whose company manages six other hotels in Manhattan. “New York remains one of the most traveled destinations in the world.”

Andres Escobar designed the Jade’s interiors and said that Mr. Obeid “wanted to blend into the Village,” which is why Mr. Escobar used materials like Macassar ebony wood and marble to evoke an old world style. The Jade also has a restaurant operated by Frederick Lesort called Grapevine, an homage to the Village’s 19th century speakeasy of the same name. Nightly room rates begin at $400.

Denihan Hospitality Group, an independent owner and operator of boutique hotels, is looking at three development sites in Manhattan’s financial district, Chelsea and in Midtown. “We’ve seen a traveler preference away from large brands and homogeneity, toward distinctive hotels with personality, where the traveler feels connected to the community instead of a generic box,” said David J. Duncan, president of Denihan, which operates hotels in New York, including the James Hotel in SoHo and the Affinia brand.

Developers are also converting old commercial buildings into hotels, which are cheaper and quicker to complete than building from scratch. Older office buildings with small floorplates are well-suited for hotels, and they can be converted in commercial zoning districts where residential is forbidden, said Mr. McConnell of Cushman & Wakefield.

The Flatiron district has become a hotbed for such conversions. At the Metropolitan Life Tower, the clock tower overlooking Madison Square Park, Marriott International and the hotelier Ian Schrager are planning an upscale hotel conversion after buying the property for $165 million from Africa Israel USA last October.

Five blocks north, the Sydell Group, the investor Ron Burkle and Square Mile Capital converted an aging Art Deco office building into the NoMad Hotel for $100 million. The 168-room hotel, at 1170 Broadway, opened in March.

The Sydell Group previously converted the nearby Ace Hotel at 20 West 29th Street. Andrew E. Zobler, chief executive of the Sydell Group, said the Ace was one of the first hotels to have an active lobby, which regularly presents live music, helping to lure customers. “I think people are yearning for more of an experience,” he said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:

An article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday, about a hotel building boom in New York, misstated the name of a research firm in one reference.

WHITE and modern in a neighborhood of mud and brick, the Jardín el Porvenir kindergarten occupies half a dozen two-story concrete-and-glass pods scattered like children’s blocks on an oval campus here. A metal fence shaped like a bamboo forest encloses the school, which borders a basketball court and plaza where people gather and teenagers play soccer. From inside the school, children look out on the neighborhood. From the outside, the kindergarten is a landmark and social magnet for a corner of a poor, sprawling district, Bosa, southwest of this city’s center.

Less than a decade ago the big story here involved a pair of pioneering mayors, Antanas Mockus and Enrique Peñalosa, and the transformations they brought about in a capital notorious for drugs and terrorism. Mr. Mockus focused on cultivating a culture of civil society, on seemingly little things like obedience to traffic signals, which were really about big things like promoting civic self-esteem, a sense of shared responsibility for the welfare of the city and a climate of workable streets and sidewalks. Then Mr. Peñalosa, his successor, promoted public space and tackled infrastructural improvements, installing bike lanes and a rapid bus system called TransMilenio that extended to the expanding population of poor people occupying remote districts like Bosa. Optimism boomed.

But the bus system has deteriorated during the last several years, a victim of its own popularity but also of the failure by recent leaders to expand routes as promised, repair crumbling roads, relieve the overcrowding and fight crime. Green-minded laws fashioned to reduce car traffic and pollution, a big problem here, have perversely ended up, fueled by the TransMilenio’s woes, encouraging more Bogotans to get second cars and buy motorcycles. The ouster and arrest of another mayor last year on corruption charges was the last straw.

Bogotá had been “a cause,” as Mr. Mockus put it. Now it has become a problem.

“We’re Latin,” he explained. A deadpan, wry, highly unconventional politician and former mathematics and philosophy professor, Mr. Mockus famously mooned student protesters as a university president and as mayor went on television while taking a shower to demonstrate the virtues of saving water. “The worst thing for a Latin man is to find himself raising another man’s child,” he told me when we met recently. He was talking about the refusal by many Colombian politicians to adopt plans their predecessors conceived, instead preferring to invent their own. So the ousted mayor, Samuel Moreno, had argued for a metro to deal with what the buses couldn’t seem to handle, which may well be necessary in a city whose capital district has almost the same population as New York.

But the existing system was left unattended. I took a mobbed bus one evening, and an hour and a half later, having crawled barely four miles, I struggled onto the street, exhausted. Pickpockets are common on crowded buses in cities everywhere. Here, though, a woman next to me said she watched a man steal her purse in front of her eyes a few nights earlier, unable to move her arms because the bus had been so jammed. Polls show optimism has fallen to its lowest point in 15 years.

The larger story of Bogotá’s former progress really goes beyond Mr. Mockus and Mr. Peñalosa to plans devised for the city more than a decade ago by remarkable architects and urban planners like Lorenzo Castro, who laid out squares, bridges, public spaces and other areas for civic improvement. A government initiative to recover parcels of the city taken over by private individuals (rich and poor), turning them into places for the benefit of whole communities, played an equally crucial role in changing the map and political climate.

On a recent visit I found pockets of hope that still endure in works of public architecture built in and around the city, many linked to the rapid bus lines and the bike lanes. Ultimately Bogotá is a reminder that the economic and social lives of neighborhoods and whole cities rise and fall depending on access to public transit, public parks, public spaces.","BogotÃ¡, the Colombian capital, relies on recent architectural innovations in libraries and schools as oases of civility and pride.",35.652173913,0.652173913,0.9130434783,high,low,abstractive,architecture

New York firefighters worked with scientists from Underwriters Laboratories and the Commerce Department to test new techniques.

Smoke billowed out of an open basement window on Governors Island on Monday and flames climbed the walls, spreading to the rest of the building. At least a dozen firefighters stood idly by, watching and waiting.

A building on Governors Island was stocked with lights, sensors, cameras and modern plastic-filled furniture before being set alight.

Video and other feeds from the burning building allowed scientists to monitor fire data from a safe distance.

The fire, burning inside the uninhabited two-story brick building, had been ignited minutes earlier in a controlled setting, for the New York Fire Department to study how fires spread in the modern home filled with plastic-filled furniture, which burns quickly.

Before the fire got under way, Building D, done up with furnishings that had once been in hotel rooms, was loaded with equipment. Video and thermal cameras transmitted images to monitors in a command center nearby. Sensors, many wrapped in ceramic fibers and aluminum foil to protect them from the flames, measured the flow of gases, the temperature and the pressure at various points inside.

Researchers from Underwriters Laboratories and from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, part of the Commerce Department, stood alongside the firefighters, watching the flames take hold. This was one of 20 burns planned for the week to examine different strategies for putting out fires.

“The real beauty of this is working with the fire service,” said Daniel Madrzykowski, a fire protection engineer with the government institute. “We can do lots of things in the laboratories, but firefighters don’t fight fires in laboratories.”

The fire in Building D started with a countdown and the push of a button that sent a spark to ignite a matchbox sitting on a sofa; only a window was left open. The room’s single entryway made it hard for the fire to expand as it burned through the limited oxygen available. As expected, when a firefighter pried a door open, the flames grew and began to spread up into the first floor.

As plastic furniture fillings have replaced cotton ones in American houses, fires have typically spread faster, the flames consuming much of the oxygen around them quickly. Once firefighters arrive at a fire, they often begin by opening a door or window to look inside and ventilate smoke. With the influx of oxygen, flames can expand in a flash, injuring firefighters.

One objective of this week’s tests is to explore whether, and how, the Fire Department should apply water without trying to ventilate the room — possibly avoiding sudden fire bursts.

“The faster you get water on the fire the better,” said Steve Keber, a research engineer for Underwriters Laboratories.

Robert Maynes, a deputy assistant chief, stressed that even if the Fire Department’s methodology changed, protecting human life would remain its first priority.

In a test in another building, the temperature and levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide in bedrooms on higher floors will be monitored as a fire burns downstairs, so firefighters can understand how quickly conditions upstairs become fatal. When that fire has been ignited, one bedroom door will be closed and another left open: because simple variables can make huge changes in how fire behaves, researchers expect the differences to be pronounced.

Back in Building D, after the flames moved to the second story, the firefighting began. Where firefighters would normally try to get above the flames, in this test they sprayed water through an open window. Later this week, a firefighter will instead use a high-powered fire extinguisher to dampen the flames in a room before closing internal doors to block the fire .

“Change doesn’t come easy,” Chief Maynes said. But he said the Fire Department would adapt.","The New York Fire Department is conducting a series of controlled burns, working with a team of scientists to study firefighting techniques adapted to homes filled with modern materials.",24.2580645161,0.8064516129,1.6451612903,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

Mr. Brin then began one of the most elaborate product announcements I’ve ever seen. He connected to a group of skydivers flying above San Francisco, who jumped out of the plane, wearing Google glasses and streaming their view as they plummeted to earth at 135 miles per hour. The skydivers landed successfully, thankfully, on the roof of the Moscone Center, where the Google I/O event is being held.

Like any good James Bond movie, it didn’t stop there. Stunt bicycles flipped in the air and people rappelled off the side of the building — all while wearing Google glasses.

The audience cheered and a lot of sweaty palms grasped their phones to take pictures of the skydivers as they entered the building and ascended to the stage.

But the show didn’t end there.

Even more stirring than the spectacular skydiver entrance was that Mr. Brin said the company would begin taking orders from software developers for Google glasses for $1,500 each. Google glasses will begin shipping to developers next year, he said.

Some of the engineers responsible for building Google glasses then joined Mr. Brin on stage to discuss the evolution of the project.

“We created glass so you can interact with the virtual world without obstructing the real world,” explained Isabelle Olsson, who is leading the design efforts for Google glasses. “We don’t want technology to get in the way.”

Ms. Olsson said that the team had focused on creating something that is “ridiculously light” and that the “latest prototype weighs less on your nose than many sunglasses.”

In a video shown at the event, a woman using Google glasses while playing with her baby offered this compelling line: “She smiles at faces, not at devices.”

During the demonstration, the Google glasses team said the company had two goals for the glasses: communicating with images and giving people access to information. And there was possibly a third: the ability to do both without having to pull a phone from your pocket.","At the Google I/O developer conference, Google's Project Glass augmented-reality glasses made a grand entrance.

“No, she’s a girl,” her mother corrected.

“But!” the little girl said, “That’s the doorman!”

Doorwoman, actually. Doorperson, or door attendant, would be fine, too. None of these terms, however, are widely in use, because even though there are thousands of people in New York City who do the job, only a few hundred of them are women. And the pace of change has been glacial.

According to 32BJ, the largest building employee union in the city, about 12,800 of its members in the five boroughs are employed as doormen, porters and the like in residential buildings. How many are women? Only 302. Of the nearly 3,000 residential superintendents in the union, the number of women is 45.

“We all say ‘doormen’ for a reason: you really don’t see many women doing it,” said Amy Peterson, the president of Nontraditional Employment for Women, a nonprofit organization that trains women for jobs in male-dominated fields like construction and building maintenance. “But that’s not because employers don’t want to hire women, and it’s not because women aren’t ready.”

One reason, a spokeswoman for 32BJ suggested, is that the turnover in those jobs is quite low. Doorman, superintendent and porter positions are good union jobs (the minimum wage for a doorman in a typical apartment building is $20.77 an hour, before tips) with benefit plans and regular raises, and are not in danger of being shipped overseas. Often, such jobs are held by the same person for a few decades, or even passed down to the next generation.

“To get a doorman job, usually somebody has to die,” Ms. Catus said, with only a hint of exaggeration.

But there are women who have muscled in, who are out there doing those jobs and doing them well, their employers say.

At the Beatrice, a high-end rental building on West 29th Street, two women are employed. One of them, Orla DiTaranto, 31, has been working as a doorwoman (as she calls herself) since the building opened in 2010. Ms. DiTaranto says that while her co-workers are very supportive, disparaging comments about her sex and her job from the people who pass through can be a daily occurrence.

“Just don’t let anybody walk all over you, because they will if you let them,” Ms. DiTaranto said. And if they give you trouble, she added with a chuckle, “give them a little kick.”

When someone questions a doorwoman’s ability to do her job, many say, the focus is usually on security.

Stephanie Vega, who works at the M at Beekman on East 50th Street, said that a man looking for an apartment for his daughter once asked Ms. Vega what kind of security background she had.

“Were you in the Army?” he asked, Ms. Vega recounted. “No, I wasn’t in the Army, but that’s why we have a telephone,” she said. “We call 911 when something happens.”

Mary Signorella, a general manager at Cooper Square Realty who oversees the Southgate cooperative where Ms. Catus has been working, pointed out that building security generally has more to do with keeping a pair of eyes on the door than with hand-to-hand combat.

“No one I know is going to say, ‘Stop with your gun! You can’t get past me!’ ” Ms. Signorella said.

The Southgate, which is made up of four buildings on 52nd Street between First Avenue and the East River and an additional one on 51st Street, recently experienced a groundswell in the number of female employees, as six women were hired to fill in as porters or door staff members for the summer while regular workers are on vacation. All six were referred by Nontraditional Employment for Women, where a Southgate resident, Nicola Heryet, sits on the board.

The organization has been training women for jobs in male-dominated fields for more than 30 years, and construction jobs have long made up a large portion of its placements. But when the recession struck, construction projects dried up, Ms. Heryet explained, so the organization began to focus more on building services. This spring, it offered its first supplemental class in building operations to its graduates.

On a recent Thursday evening, eight women sat in the class (held in a brightly lighted basement shop room lined with power tools) learning all about HVAC systems and mold. The students included a former hairdresser looking for the stability of a union job and the superintendent at a supportive housing facility for people living with AIDS, who wanted to learn more about how to run her building.

Slowly, more women are being hired to do such jobs, and the sight of a woman in these particular roles will become more commonplace. But there are a few who have already been at it for decades.

Theresa Salfi started helping out at a building on Sullivan Street 50 years ago, when her father became the super there, and she officially took over for him when he died. Today, she and her brother, Joey Maietta, still work there together. But it is Ms. Salfi who is in charge.

“I’m the super,” Ms. Salfi said. “He’s my handyman. He helps me.”","Even though there are thousands of people in New York City who work as doormen, only a few hundred are women. And the pace of change has been glacial.",33.5625,1.0,9.8125,medium,high,extractive,architecture

Mr. Norton offered an empty corner in his expanded downtown apartment, and soon he and Mr. Houghton were holding cocktail parties and private viewings.

Mr. Norton’s friend Barry Diller came by one snowy morning; the foundation financed by Mr. Diller and his wife, Diane Von Furstenberg, ended up donating $3 million. This winter Mr. Norton hosted the hedge fund magnate William A. Ackman and his wife, Karen, who, like Mr. Norton, is on the board of the High Line. Even though the Ackmans have never seen a Signature production, they donated $25 million last week through their foundation.

On Tuesday Mr. Houghton, Mr. Norton and their friends will gather in finery to open the $66 million Signature Center, one of the most ambitious new cultural complexes in New York in decades and a testament to the value of long-term relationships.

Mr. Norton was an aspiring young actor out of Yale in 1993 when he auditioned for an Edward Albee production at Signature; he didn’t get the role, but Mr. Houghton liked what he saw and cast him in another Albee play, “Fragments.” (Most Signature seasons are devoted to a single playwright, a distinction that will continue among Signature’s expanded offerings.) Mr. Norton said that role earned him his first paycheck as an actor.

“Jim is an incredibly loyal man, to his actors and writers and also to his institutional vision for retrospective work at Signature, and his spirit was one I’ve loved being around,” said Mr. Norton, who, less than three years after “Fragments,” was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor for his feature film debut in “Primal Fear.” (He also starred in an acclaimed Signature production of “Burn This” in 2002.)

“So when Jim asked me to co-chair the capital campaign in August 2008,” he continued, “even when the bottom fell out of the economy the next month, with the Lehman collapse, I thought, ‘We can do this.’ ”

Mr. Houghton, also the director of the esteemed drama division at the Juilliard School, has managed a daunting feat in an economic downturn by attracting true believers to the 12-year planning effort for Signature’s home. Early on, he won friends in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s administration by agreeing to base Signature in a proposed performing arts center by Mr. Gehry at ground zero, then a key part of the redevelopment in Lower Manhattan. But the cost and logistics of the project became untenable, and by 2007 Mr. Houghton and Mr. Gehry were discussing a new home closer to the Times Square theater district.

The city has remained a supporter of Signature (as well as of other theaters seeking new homes), providing $27.5 million of the $66 million needed; Mayor Bloomberg’s own foundation is donating $3 million, Mr. Houghton said.

The center, which is opening on Tuesday night with a production of Athol Fugard’s “Blood Knot,” includes three theaters, an expansive cafe and bookstore space, with sofas, open to the public (and free WiFi), and a gleaming glass marquee that newly lights a stretch of West 42nd Street near 10th Avenue. (Signature’s former home, a single theater located a block farther west, away from Times Square, is seeking new tenants.)

Another important relationship has been Mr. Houghton’s with Juilliard, which will base a new training program for drama students at Signature Center. Juilliard’s financial contribution will probably be a wash, given that Signature could probably otherwise rent that space; the artistic contribution, meanwhile, will be the energy of having Juilliard students and teachers working there.

“What mattered most in creating the center was proposing a bigger scale for Signature — the sort of scale that would excite major donors — while at the same time making clear that our mission would remain steady,” Mr. Houghton said in an interview in his modest office overlooking 42nd Street. “We’re not going to start creating a bunch of new musicals. We’re not going to start casting celebrity actors or aim things to transfer to Broadway.”

Part of the sales pitch of Signature’s capital campaign was the theater’s unusual commitment to low ticket prices: thanks to corporate and private underwriting, tickets are expected to cost only $25 for the next decade. (They ranged from $15 to $20 in recent years.)

Mr. Norton said Signature still had about $10 million left to raise for the combined needs of construction and the subsidized tickets. As for his own donation, he said, “I’m waiting to see what the gap is going to be when we get to the real zero hour.” Mr. Norton’s involvement is rare for a high-profile actor; he has proved to be Signature’s rainmaker, working virtually full time over the last two years and passing up several film projects to stay close to New York to help raise the money.

The addition of two new theaters is only one part of Signature’s expansion. The company, which has chiefly produced revivals, recently began an unusual residency program for playwrights that guarantees each of them three productions over a five-year period, as well as a $50,000 cash award and health insurance. The first playwrights in residence are Annie Baker (“Circle Mirror Transformation”), Will Eno (“Middletown”), Katori Hall (“The Mountaintop”), Kenneth Lonergan (“The Starry Messenger”) and Regina Taylor (“Crowns”).

Mr. Houghton estimated that Signature would produce 45 plays over the next five years, with about 35 of them new works. By comparison, over the previous five years, Signature produced about 20 plays, and about two-thirds were revivals.

Mr. Eno, a 2005 Pulitzer Prize finalist for “Thom Pain (based on nothing),” said he decided to accept the Signature playwriting residency largely because of Mr. Houghton.

“Like almost no one I know, he manages to have both a deeply comprehensive and specific vision of things, along with a really wide-open and kind of down-home way,” Mr. Eno said. “It makes you feel very comfortable to be around someone who is both so aggressively detail-oriented and who’s also generally calm.”

The playwriting residencies have provoked some private grumbling among a few theater executives and playwrights’ agents, concerned that Signature is hoarding the talent. Yet none of those concerned would speak on the record.

“I’m sure people have opinions,” Mr. Houghton said, “but there is also plenty of remarkable theater going on in this city. And now Signature can be doing more of it.”","Signature Theater Company opens its new home on Tuesday, an ambitious project undertaken in the midst of the recession.",64.1904761905,0.7619047619,1.1428571429,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Rescuers needed hours on Wednesday to free the body of Suzanne Hart, 41, who worked at the advertising firm Y&R.

Then, in an inexplicable instant, after Ms. Hart placed one foot inside, the elevator suddenly lurched up, its door still open, according to the Fire Department. It dragged her until she was pinned between the elevator and the wall, between the first and second floors, the police said.

Two passengers in the elevator car could only watch in horror, and would remain trapped in the elevator for an hour before rescuers could free them.

Ms. Hart was declared dead at the scene, but her body was not removed until nearly 7 p.m.

There are about 60,000 elevators in New York City, which were involved in 53 accidents last year. But just three of them were fatal, making the mechanics and the violence of Ms. Hart’s death all the more unusual.

The specter of something as mundane as an elevator ride turning deadly haunted the building, at 285 Madison Avenue, and its stricken workers for the rest of the day. The building was evacuated, and employees were told to work from home on Thursday. Friends and family of Ms. Hart reeled in shock, struggling to come to terms with the loss of a woman they uniformly described as generous, driven and warm.

Ms. Hart was a director of new business and content at Y&R, formerly Young & Rubicam, which represents brands like Campbell Soup, Land Rover and Xerox. She had worked there since June 2007, according to her profile on LinkedIn, and quickly developed a reputation for working long hours while maintaining a spirit that knitted people together.

“Suzanne was just one of the most wonderful people in the world,” said Chad Kawalec, a former director of client services at Y&R.

“She was constantly trying to orchestrate teams of people who had never worked together, but she magically got them to work together.”

Ms. Hart’s father, Alex Hart, called her “the most marvelous daughter imaginable.”

“No father could have ever been more proud of her,” he said by phone from his home in Florida, weeping as he spoke.

As of Wednesday night, investigators had not determined what caused the malfunction of the elevator, one of 13 at 285 Madison, a 28-story building at the corner of 40th Street that was built in 1926. Records from the city’s Department of Buildings show there were 14 open violations involving the building’s elevators, two of them dating to last year. But a spokesman for the agency said none of those violations were for hazardous conditions.

“This particular elevator was last inspected in June 2011, and no safety issues were found at that time, and no conditions were found that would be related to this accident,” the spokesman, Tony Sclafani, said.

As rare as elevator accidents are, Mr. Kawalec said the elevators at 285 Madison Avenue were old and creaky. “They weren’t the kind of elevators that you stuck your hand in to catch the doors,” he said, “because they wouldn’t stop.”

This month, Y&R announced plans to move to 3 Columbus Circle, near the Time Warner Center, partly because the Madison Avenue building was a warren of small offices and the agency wanted open spaces. Other tenants in the building, including Kang & Lee, Blast Radius, BrandBuzz and Bravo, planned to move, too.

David Sable, a Y&R executive, said 285 Madison was “not a suitable building for us and probably hasn’t been for a number of years.”

Outside the high-pressure world of advertising, Ms. Hart harbored a creative and nurturing side.

Michael Meseke, who lived across the hall from Ms. Hart at her former residence on Carmine Street in the West Village for about five years, said she filled her home with small paintings she was working on and grew lush plants on the fire escape.

Mr. Meseke recalled that when his parents visited from California, Ms. Hart would stay at her boyfriend’s apartment so that his parents could use her place.

Andrea Meyer, who lives on the building’s fourth floor, said she and Ms. Hart frequently joked and commiserated about their mutual desire to shed weight. “She was always trying to lose 10 pounds, like me, and when she did, she was so excited,” Ms. Meyer said.

A few years ago, Ms. Hart met Chris Dickson, who would become her boyfriend. About a year ago, the couple moved to an apartment in Brooklyn Heights, where friends say Ms. Hart realized one of her dreams — to have her own garden in the city.

As dusk fell, reporters gathered outside the four-story Brooklyn building where Ms. Hart and Mr. Dickson lived. Appearing briefly on the stoop out front, Mr. Dickson spoke briefly about Ms. Hart.

“She’s a beautiful person, and I don’t have words for this,” he said. “I loved her.”

The police said the protesters had apparently held a mock trial of Goldman Sachs at their encampment in Zuccotti Park before setting out for the building to deliver their verdict.

When they got to the building, several crowded the pace in front of the building.

“They were asked to move numerous times, and failed to do so,” a police spokesman said. “Consequently, arrests had to be made.” No protester entered the building, the police said.

There were no injuries as the protesters were taken into custody and transported to to the Seventh Precinct for processing, the police said.

A Goldman Sachs security manager said the event included about 100 protesters who walked west on Murray Street and crossed the West Side Highway to 200 West Street, the Goldman Sachs building, and began demonstrating.

The manager, who would not provide his name, said that about a dozen in the group simply sat down on a wide sidewalk in front of the main entrance to the building. He said that Goldman Sachs officials did not call the police, but rather that police officers who had been following the marchers ordered those who were seated to get up. He confirmed the police account, saying that when the protesters refused, they were arrested.

He stressed that the event was not marked by violence — on either side.

Soon after, the remaining protesters marched back across the busy highway and east on Murray Street.

By about 2 p.m., there was no presence of the protesters outside Goldman Sachs location. Seven uniformed police officers were there, standing guard outside the building.

Later on Thursday, at Zuccotti Park, a protester who serves as a medic for the demonstration, said the mock trial at the park resulted in a guilty verdict against Goldman Sachs.

The medic, who only provided his first name, Red, said the trial took the form of a series of lectures. Two of the many charges against the firm included violating securities law and perpetrating fraud, said the medic, who has been camped out at the park since September.

After the trial, the protesters marched north on Church Street and then West on Murray and then toward the bank building. He said that more and more protesters joined the march. When they arrived outside Goldman Sachs, one protester, a woman, announced the guilty verdict and gave a speech of several minutes denouncing the investment bank.

The medic, 20, from upstate New York, said there were about 10 uniformed officers – including one on a scooter and two or three in riot gear – standing in front of the bank’s entrance. The police initially ordered the protesters away from the building. At that point, the medic said, about eight protesters sat down in front of the bank’s entrance, in the form of a circle, and with their arms linked. Among them was Reverend Billy, a protestor, and Chris Hedges.

“One cop yelled at their faces with a bullhorn and then one by one started pulling people out of the circle,” said the medic.

Of the Goldman Sachs employees, the medic said that many were looking out from windows above and training cameras on the scene below.

As the protestors moved away from the building, they chanted: “We’ll be back.”

In a separate episode at Zuccotti Park on Thursday afternoon, the police said three people were taken into custody for, “loitering while wearing a mask.”","The police said the protesters apparently held a mock trial of Goldman Sachs, a main target of the Occupy Wall Street movement, at their encampment in Zuccotti Park before setting out for the building to deliver their verdict.",18.3414634146,0.9756097561,9.1219512195,medium,high,extractive,architecture

For a competition, students from three schools worked on a superefficient home.

HOBOKEN, N.J. — On summer evenings, the running path along the riverfront here is clogged with businessmen on smartphones tripping over dog leashes and joggers weaving through a stream of strollers. It had gotten even more congested recently as curious pedestrians congregated around a fenced-off parking lot on Sinatra Drive to guess the purpose of the structure being built inside.

“People have asked us if we’re building a waterfront bar,” said a worker, Steve Scribner. “As if Hoboken needs any more. Someone else thought it was a houseboat, or some kind of giant Porta-Potty.”

But even taking into account Hoboken’s love affair with happy hour, there was an urgency to the building process that seemed incongruous. Someone was always there hammering or sawing — and many of the workers seemed a little young for cocktails.

The compact, shoe-box-shaped mystery building is named Empowerhouse, and it is a superefficient, solar-powered house that will compete in the Solar Decathlon, an event sponsored by the Energy Department that will open on Friday on the National Mall in Washington. It was designed and built by architecture and engineering students from Parsons The New School for Design, the Stevens Institute of Technology and the Milano School of International Affairs, Management and Urban Policy.

Yet the group aimed to create a structure that would endure in a meaningful way after the competition results are in. Unlike the 19 other entries, Empowerhouse is destined to become a real home for a low-income family in the Deanwood neighborhood of Northeast Washington that will also serve as a model of sustainable housing for Habitat for Humanity.

This year, for the first time, houses in the competition are being graded on cost-effectiveness, as well as energy efficiency and attractiveness. The last winning house was a $2 million entry from Germany with an exterior completely covered in solar panels.

“They racked up extra points because they were producing power above and beyond what the house needed,” said Joshua Laryea, student project engineer from Stevens. “But who can afford a house like that and maintain all those solar panels? It wasn’t a place designed for living in.”

Joel Towers, the executive dean at Parsons, said: “We probably won’t be the shiniest box on the Mall, but a lot of the technology that’s needed for tomorrow’s housing is already available. The question we’re trying to answer is more social than technological — how do we actually bring these green solutions into neighborhoods?”

Empowerhouse tackles cost-effectiveness through “passive house” design principles, an international standard to minimize energy demand that is just beginning to gain traction in the United States. Passive houses are well insulated and nearly airtight, with 12-inch walls and triple-glazed windows, and they require up to 90 percent less energy for heating and cooling than an ordinary house. (They consume 40 percent less than a typical high-efficiency home.)

Such low energy consumption enabled Empowerhouse to have one of the smallest solar panel arrays in the competition, which helps keep construction and maintenance costs down.

For Habitat for Humanity of Washington, the Empowerhouse project is just the beginning of a new wave of sustainable housing. Once the house is moved to Deanwood, Habitat will work with the students and other volunteers to transform the 1,000-square-foot house — estimated to cost about $250,000 — into a two-family duplex of 2,700 square feet with an eventual estimated cost of $530,000. Two more three-unit passive town houses are in the design phase, and construction is scheduled to start in the Ivy City neighborhood of Northeast Washington in the spring.

Kent Adcock, president of the Washington affiliate of Habitat for Humanity, said that in the future, all construction originating from his group would be based on the passive house model — quite an achievement for a team of students, most of whom had never picked up a power tool before this summer’s construction project.

“We’re designers — most of us hadn’t really handled much more than an X-Acto knife before this summer,” said Jason Hudspeth, a student project architect and a graduate of Parsons. “X-Acto knives aren’t very handy when you’re trying to put up drywall or pour cement.”

While constructing a passive house costs about 10 to 12 percent more than Habitat’s current models, this upfront cost is more than offset by the near elimination of utility bills. For a comparably sized home in the Deanwood neighborhood, utility bills are about $2,300 annually, and with energy prices predicted to continue rising, over the course of a Habitat home’s average 25-year mortgage, a homeowner could save anywhere from $61,000 to $132,000.

“These savings could be the difference in that family advancing their education, or paying for child care, or even in investing for retirement,” Mr. Adcock said.

In June, his group is planning to host a conference for Habitat for Humanity affiliates from across the country to share what they have learned about passive house design and construction. Empowerhouse will serve as a model for an easily replicated, affordable, energy-efficient home for urban communities.

A more immediate concern was carefully taking apart what they had spent all summer putting together so that it could be moved to the National Mall for judging. The move took place last week.

“It took us so many tries to get everything right,” said Mr. Scribner, a recent architecture graduate from Parsons. “It’s kind of nerve-racking to have to take it all apart. It’s going to be one heck of a 3-D puzzle to put back together.”",A team of students from three schools is taking part in a competition to build a superefficient home.,59.0,0.8947368421,2.5789473684,high,medium,mixed,architecture

Mabanglo/European Pressphoto Agency

With no roof on any show court, the United States Open could require a Monday finish (or later) because of rain for the fourth year in a row.

If the Romans could put a roof on the ancient Colosseum, why can’t the United States Tennis Association add a roof to one of its show courts at the United States Open? The question has, well, hung over the premier domestic tennis event for 20 years, since the U.S.T.A. opted for the sensational over the sensible in constructing Arthur Ashe Stadium, the tournament’s marquee court.

The question gathers more steam with each major storm that blows through the New York area and grinds play to a halt at the final Grand Slam event on the tennis calendar. In each of the last three years, the Open has been extended a day because of weather disruptions, and this year’s tournament appears headed for a fourth straight Monday finish — if then.

“Is there an incremental expense to it? Absolutely,” Jim Curley, the tournament director, said of the possibility of a Monday finish. “It’s not ideal for the players, the tournament or television.”

In the city that never sleeps, some of the best players in the world were reduced on Wednesday to dozing on couches in the lounge as they waited a second straight day for match calls that never came because of rain that was no more than a mist. It was the first time since 1971 that the Open lost two consecutive days of tennis.

“Is it necessary? Maybe not,” Roger Federer, a five-time champion, said at the Open two years ago when asked about a roofed stadium. “But with a roof you can make it more predictable for fans, sponsors, TV, players. That’s why I’m obviously for it. In America, we have so many wonderful stadiums, you figure it’s normal they would be taking the lead with something like this.”

It is not as if a retractable roof is a pied-à-terre-in-the-sky idea. The Australian Open, which has had a roofed stadium since 1989, now has two covered courts and plans for a third. Wimbledon, considered the most staid of the majors, unveiled its high-tech roof over Centre Court in 2009. And at the French Open, where weather is seldom a factor, a retractable roof is in the works as part of the renovations planned for Philippe Chatrier Court.

“We were just saying it’s strange that there’s no roof here when all the other major venues have a roof,” said Richard Young, who had plenty of time on his hands to ponder the imponderable. He and his son Roman were waiting out the rain at Louis Armstrong Stadium.

The Youngs were in town from Utah on a tennis vacation, so the U.S.T.A.’s promise of tickets to next year’s event if the day session was canceled (as it was) provided little consolation.

“In these times of recession,” the elder Young said, “a roof is a shovel-ready project.”

The plans the U.S.T.A. made public in November include expanding the capacity of its second show court, Armstrong stadium, by more than 3,000 seats, to 14,000. The grandstand court, considered the drawing room of the National Tennis Center because of its intimacy, could grow to 7,000 seats, from 6,100.

With 23,771 seats, Ashe Stadium is the largest tennis arena in the world. Its sheer size makes covering it a conundrum for reasons having to do with structural integrity and the bottom line.

To planes on approach at nearby La Guardia, Ashe looks like a marooned U.F.O. The top of the stadium is so high and wide that it would require architectural ingenuity to cover it, and even then it would be larger and more obtrusive.

The stadium, which opened in 1997, was built for $254 million, and it has been estimated that a retractable roof would cost at least another $150 million.

When considering whether to cover Ashe, the price tag is only part of the consideration. The stadium is the only show court with suites; there are 90 that are leased for roughly $250,000 each.

If the U.S.T.A. were to include a roof as part of the Armstrong or grandstand renovations, it would have to contend with fallout from premium ticket holders and suite occupants reduced on rainy days to watching the action much like the average fans at home, on the televisions in their suites or the giant screen on the court.

“All of a sudden you’re going to tell them they can’t see live tennis,” said Andy Roddick, the 2003 men’s champion. He added, in perhaps a bit of hyperbole, “There’s a reason why the U.S. Open does more dollars in two weeks than the Yankees do in half a season of baseball.”","A roof for a show court at the U.S. Open could resolve weather problems, but the challenges in adding one are many.",39.8333333333,0.8333333333,1.25,high,medium,abstractive,architecture

“Our police officers deserve better,” says Richard M. Aborn, standing before a wall of law books and the American flag. “Help us protect them and help make us all safer.”

The actor is Vincent D’Onofrio, who plays the earnest detective Robert Goren on television’s “Law & Order: Criminal Intent.” And with him, Mr. Aborn is lending law enforcement credibility to a proposed ban on large-capacity ammunition magazines that has gained attention in Congress since 6 people were killed and 13 injured, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, in the Tucson shootings last month.

To the uninitiated, the debate over guns and ammunition is sometimes dominated by those with entrenched views on either side, while the voice of law enforcement is sometimes drowned out. On the streets, however, it is police officers, federal agents and others who enforce the laws who, along with civilians, are often in the most danger when criminals’ firepower reaches high levels.

Indeed, Jared L. Loughner, the man accused of opening fire at the congresswoman’s public event, had an oversize magazine of bullets that allowed him to quickly fire his Glock 19 semiautomatic more than 30 times before being forced to reload.

There once was a law in place to ban such magazines. It is a law that Mr. Aborn, who served as president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence from 1993 to 1996, is credited with championing, along with the Brady Bill and other legislation. But the law had a sunset provision and, in 2004, it died on the legislative vine.

So far, Mr. Aborn’s jumping back into the national debate over gun control, with Mr. D’Onofrio at his side, is having an impact. The spot has been linked to on Twitter and Facebook by Russell Simmons, the mogul, rap impresario and political advocate; and it has been sent out by New Yorkers Against Gun Violence.

“The more attention we can get to this very important issue to pass this bill, the better,” said Colin C. Weaver, that group’s deputy director.

Mr. D’Onofrio says in the ad that while the guns on his show are fake, “Our police officers face real threats every day.” He adds: “Police officers shouldn’t have to confront that much firepower on the street; it’s not fair.”

Mr. Kelly Goes to Washington

Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, no stranger to official Washington addressed the Senate’s Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on Wednesday on the topic “Safeguarding our Future: Building a Nationwide Network for First Responders” at the invitation of Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia. Here is the bulk of his speech:

Thanks to the leadership of Senator Rockefeller, Congressman King, and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, we are closer than ever to providing our nation’s first responders with a tool they desperately need: a nationwide broadband network dedicated to public safety. It was extremely encouraging to see President Obama expressing his firm support for this initiative last week.

I come to Washington today as the head of a police department that will benefit enormously from this technology. I consider it essential to the future of our mission. I know this view is shared by law enforcement agencies and fire departments, large and small, urban and rural across this country.

That’s because our existing communications systems are fast becoming obsolete. Like virtually all other public safety organizations, the New York City Police Department relies principally on the use of two-way voice radios to communicate with responding officers and direct them to a scene. However, this technology is extremely limited. We cannot use it to exchange electronic data. And although we have made progress on local radio interoperability, the lack of a common radio spectrum prevents us from establishing a truly seamless nationwide system for all first responders.

Today, a 16-year-old with a smartphone has a more advanced communications capability than a police officer or deputy carrying a radio. Given the technology that is available, and the complexity of the threat we face, that is unacceptable. It will only change if we succeed in building a nationwide broadband network to a mission-critical grade of service.

In New York City, this would enable the N.Y.P.D. to fully leverage the powerful technology that we use in our Real Time Crime Center. This is a state-of-the art computer facility we opened at our headquarters in 2005. It is supported by a massive database containing billions of public and private records. We’ve made this database searchable with the latest software. Around the clock, crime center detectives take calls from investigators in the field, looking to follow up on various leads they’ve obtained: a partial license plate, a seemingly untraceable cellphone number, a nickname or even a tattoo. They conduct instant, on the spot searches, something that previously took days of calling, faxing between agencies, and combing through paper files.

We’re also about to launch a facial recognition unit within the Real Time Crime Center. It will use digital technology to match video images of people at crime scenes to mug shots on file.

With a dedicated broadband network, we would be able to push this information out to tens of thousands of officers on patrol. For example, an officer using a hand-held device operating on this network could receive detailed information before he or she arrives at a location. This would include who lives there; whether or not the police have been there before and why; and if any of the occupants has an outstanding warrant, an order of protection, or a firearms license.

Such a network could also provide officers with an immediate, digital snapshot of anyone they detain. It would give them the suspect’s address, prior arrest history, and other critical details. The officer would be able to take electronic fingerprints at the scene and compare them instantaneously with those in local, state, and federal databases. This kind of situational awareness is vital to the safety of the officers and members of the public. And it represents the next generation of law enforcement communications.

But we can’t get there without a safe, secure, and effective broadband network over which to deliver this information, one that is built and run to public safety specifications, and one that we can control. We know from past experience that we can’t depend on systems run by the private sector. They are too susceptible to failure in a crisis. On Sept. 11 and after the 2009 crash of a commercial jet in the Hudson River, cellphone networks were deluged and police and fire communications over them became virtually impossible.

That’s a grave concern in light of the threat we face from terrorism. The New York City Police Department trains every day to prepare for large-scale disasters. But we need a network that will support a multi-agency response and all of the technology we use to keep the city safe.

To give you one example, as part of our response to the attempted car bombing in Times Square last May, we deployed a robot to inspect the vehicle. As is the case with all of our robots, it was controlled by its operator through a thin fiber-optic cable. Our need to maneuver around fire hoses and other obstacles on the street increased the risk that the cable would be run over and severed. If that had happened, we would have lost control of the robot.

With an adequate broadband network in place, we wouldn’t have to worry about that. We could control robots wirelessly, thereby removing these risks.

It would also make it easier and safer to conduct complex operations involving more than one robot — say if we found a secondary device at a bomb scene. With wireless broadband technology, we wouldn’t have to be concerned about managing multiple cables. We could also share the video feeds from our robots with the federal government and other law enforcement agencies in real time.

Right now, these capacities do not exist. But they will if we build this network.

Every public safety agency in the nation supports this effort. That is why I urge Congress in the strongest possible terms to allocate the D Block directly to public safety, and to ensure funding for this vital resource. We need adequate bandwidth, network control, and the higher standard of reliability and survivability that only a public safety network can provide. Together with our partners from across the country, the New York City Police Department looks forward to the day when we can share a broadband capability that delivers voice, video, and data on a dedicated wireless network. For the sake of the security of cities and towns throughout our nation, I sincerely hope we see that day soon.

Most of my work as a photographer centers on urban development in the sense of construction and expansion. But not all development succeeds, and not all construction lasts. In recent years a number of cities in Britain have recognized that some of the large public housing projects built during the postwar era have been failures; what were supposed to be new residential communities have been overtaken by crime and drug use. In several cases, particularly unmanageable buildings have even been torn down.

Living Rooms explores the past, present and future of domestic life.

Some years ago I became interested in photographing such a demolition, especially one of an entire housing block. Razing existing structures to prepare for new development is standard practice in urban planning. Demolition, therefore, becomes part of the question I ask about all of the construction sites, suburban sprawl and infrastructure I photograph: How do we decide what sort of development is sustainable, and how do we respond to that which is unsustainable? In 2003 I finally got my chance: the implosion of a 16-story public housing tower in Dundee, Scotland.

The tower was one of a pair that opened in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with a total of 360 apartments. The towers were part of a public housing development called Whitfield, a new neighborhood on Dundee’s northeast side. Most of the project consists of low-rise apartment buildings arranged around courtyards. For the most part, these were considered a success, with low crime rates and integrated communities. But the isolated towers were not. In 2003 the Whitfield Partnership, which now runs the development, decided to replace them with the same low-rise housing clusters that make up the rest of the neighborhood.

I am a proponent of decent, affordable public housing. So it is reflexively disturbing, personally, to see an entire form of public housing condemned. At the same time, the Whitfield towers were poorly conceived architecture: pre-fab concrete slabs, oppressive and unaesthetic. Their former population was geographically isolated from the rest of the neighborhood, and their secluded hallways and passageways between buildings facilitated criminal behavior of all sorts, from robbery to violence.

I attained up-close access to the demolition through a specialized service firm that provided ground-vibration data to the blast masters. With the company’s support, I got clearance to take photographs from the roof of the adjacent tower, which was demolished later.

As with all my work, I was interested in finding a formal perspective uncommon enough to startle viewers into a reconsideration of our built environment. In this sense, the rooftop vantage point was perfect: I was as close as safely possible to the impending implosion, with a unique elevated view, looking down as the buildings fell. I had three cameras, corresponding to each picture in the accompanying triptych, rigged to the edge of the roof facing the doomed tower, which I connected and synchronized to one another via radio receivers. All I had to do was press a button on a transmitter to simultaneously trigger them.

The tower was scheduled for demolition at 11 a.m. The day before, I was allowed to walk around the site. I had seen many homes before occupancy, but this was new to me: a former living space, post-occupancy, evidence of its failure to function as a home. In many ways, it was a typical modern public housing project, with small apartments, low ceilings and colorful doorways — but completely empty. The only marks of its former occupied life were shards of glass, broken furniture and walls covered in graffiti. I later saw a film, Andrea Arnold’s “Red Road,” in which the protagonist goes to a party in a grungy public housing apartment in Glasgow; today the fictional and real experiences have blended in my mind.

The next morning I took my position atop the adjacent tower, where I waited for hours as the blast masters made their final preparations. Eleven o’clock came and went. Brief but frequent rains threatened to disrupt my setup, but I could no longer leave the premises to find adequate equipment protection — the area had been sealed and my building evacuated. The plastic wrapping I had taped around each camera would have to suffice.

I was alone, so close to the site; the demolition team was positioned at a safety distance and not on the actual housing block premises. Neighborhood residents where kept even further away, behind a chain link fence.

Eventually I heard over my radio that the detonations were imminent. Warning shots and a siren gave a moment’s alert. Nevertheless, I was completely unprepared for the intensity and the impact of the blasts. There was a series of deafening bangs — an avid music lover, I remember fearing for my ears. I fired my cameras. The building fell into itself within seconds, swallowed by billowing clouds rising from the ground, expanding everywhere.

What compels me most in the resulting images is the sudden absence of the Whitfield tower and the way the cloud’s shape describes an impact of a large mass hitting the earth. The idea that something so large, so present in the landscape could disappear almost instantly is more interesting to me than documenting its fall frame by frame. I prefer to let the image of the apparently vanished structure conjure up speculation over its former shape, its history and the reasons for its demolition.

But it also introduces a new criminal element into the agency: the mob.

Manhattan prosecutors on Thursday accused the Luchese crime family of infiltrating the Buildings Department, saying that three of the family’s associates found jobs as building inspectors and that others in the family, including top bosses, committed a wide range of crimes.

In all, six building inspectors were accused of taking bribes to grant building permits, expedite inspections and overlook building violations. The three inspectors said to be Luchese associates were also accused of more traditional mob-related offenses, including bribery, gambling, drug trafficking, extortion and loan sharking.

Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said 27 of the 29 people named in the indictment had been arrested; the other two remain at large. Those indicted include bosses and associates of the Luchese family, officials of four corporations, real estate officials and the six building inspectors.

The Buildings Department has a history of corruption scandals, including notable ones under the Bloomberg administration. In 2002, 19 of the city’s 24 plumbing inspectors  including the chief inspector and the top supervisors in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens  were charged with extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars to approve projects throughout the city.

Last year, two crane collapses in Manhattan, which killed nine people, led to investigations by Mr. Morgenthau’s office and the Department of Investigation that exposed corruption and incompetence in the building agency’s Cranes and Derricks Division and resulted in several arrests.

Amid the problems, Patricia J. Lancaster resigned last year as buildings commissioner, the first commissioner to leave the Bloomberg administration under a cloud of controversy. Her replacement, Robert D. LiMandri, said on Thursday that he was outraged by the charges, and he sought to assure New Yorkers that their safety had not been compromised.

“As a precaution, the department has visited all of the buildings associated with the investigation to ensure safety, and we expect to complete all reinspection work soon,” Mr. LiMandri said. “These former inspectors are accused of betraying the public and this department for their own selfish gain, and they should be prosecuted to the full extent under the law.”

The indictment is a result of a two-year investigation by the district attorney’s office and the Police Department. It started in September 2007 with a gambling investigation of bosses and associates in the crime family, investigators said.

Using wiretaps of 64 telephones, 54 search warrants and even a bug hidden in a restaurant, the investigation widened to include corruption among building inspectors and purchases of narcotics and weapons, Mr. Morgenthau said.

As construction and scaffolding inspectors, two Luchese associates, Frank Francomano and his brother Carmine Francomano Jr., took bribes from builders and property owners, the indictment said. The two men “used their association with Cosa Nostra to further their criminal activity by instilling fear in victims” and paid their superiors in the crime family, said a statement by the district attorney’s office.

Thomas Masucci, another crime family associate and the owner of a construction company, SFG Associates, worked as an inspector in the Buildings Department’s Bronx division until November 2007, when he was fired for soliciting outside work from owners and contractors at sites where he was conducting inspections, the statement said.

Mr. Morgenthau said the largest known bribe was $44,000, paid by a real estate company to Carmine Francomano Jr. for “favorable dispositions” of building inspections. Altogether, Mr. Francomano accepted $82,500 in bribes, Mr. Morgenthau said.

At least three other building inspectors took bribes from members of the crime family, the district attorney’s statement said.

Mr. Morgenthau said bribes were paid to the defendants to influence the handling of violations and other issues at 19 building and construction sites in the Bronx and Manhattan.

Mr. LiMandri said that by next week the on-duty locations of every inspector would be tracked through global positioning technology installed in their department-issued cellphones, an initiative that began on Aug. 31.

The disclosure that three men identified by prosecutors as Luchese associates were working in a city agency underscores a simple truth about organized crime that is seldom understood outside the ranks of New York’s five crime families: While some mob figures reap millions from rackets, and in some cases from legitimate enterprises, many struggle to maintain a middle-class existence.

The defendants accumulated a total of about $124,000 in bribes over the two years of the investigation, bolstering their civil-service salaries, prosecutors said. Three of the building inspectors accused of taking bribes earned between $49,000 and $54,000 a year; the other three earned more.

Mr. Morgenthau said he did not know how the three associates were hired by the city.

In an unrelated gambling indictment announced almost simultaneously on Thursday, a dozen other people connected to the Luchese family were among 19 people charged. The announcement was made by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, and Andrew M. Cuomo, the state attorney general.

The indictment charges that in 2006 and 2007, nine of the defendants tried to bribe a sergeant and a detective in the Police Department who were posing as corrupt officers. The defendants were trying to protect illegal gambling operations around the city, said the indictment, which gives the names and addresses of a half-dozen gambling operations.

Illegal sports betting also played a part in the indictment that Mr. Morgenthau brought, which said that two bosses of the crime family, Joseph DiNapoli and Matthew Madonna, were accused of being paid a portion of the proceeds from other activities exposed in the investigation, including illegal sports betting.

Anthony Croce, an acting Luchese capo, controlled three associates of the family in an illegal sports betting operation, the statement by the district attorney’s office said. The office said that one such operation extended to Costa Rica, where a Luchese associate, Gary Medure, managed an offshore wire room. Mr. Morgenthau’s office has brought a civil forfeiture action against the defendants that seeks more than $411 million in proceeds.

An Obama administration adviser said the offensive is “not about the battle, it’s about the postlude” and Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top American commander in Afghanistan, that “We’ve got a government in a box, ready to roll in.”

On the principle that there is nothing new under the sun, certainly not in Afghanistan, below are some accounts from the NYT’s archives and elsewhere of how the country’s former rulers and neighbors fared when they tried to install or prop up Afghan rulers and administrations. From 170, 140, 50 and 30 years ago.

From: Encyclopaedia Britannica, Eleventh (1910-1911) edition:

The British had installed their favored ruler Shah Shuja in Kabul in August 1839:

Barely three years later, more British soldiers were marched back in to try and recover the situation.

From: The New York Times – May 31, 1871

A dispatch informs readers of the fall of the western Afghan city of Herat:

In fact Yakoob Khan reconciled with Shir Ali Khan (his father), and later signed a treaty with the British.

From: The New York Times – Nov. 13, 1955

Pashtun tribesmen were shrewdly playing off two governments against each other, a correspondent found:

Louis Dupree’s encyclopedic 1973 history “Afghanistan,” on the vast Afghan and American-funded project to develop Marja and the surrounding region of the Helmand River Valley in the late 1950s and 1960s.

From: The New York Times – Dec. 28, 1979

Shortly after the Soviets invaded in 1979, reports emerged from inside Afghanistan that the Russians were already trying to solve their Afghan problem with rubles.

Less than a month later, other accounts suggested that the Afghan security forces were proving less than fully cooperative:

From: The New York Times – January 14, 1980","""A ruler imposed upon a free people by foreign arms is always unpopular; he is unable to stand alone."" - 1910",15.88,0.36,0.36,medium,low,abstractive,architecture
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/nyregion/20building.html,https://web.archive.org/web/2007081919id_/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/nyregion/20building.html,From an Imposing Bank Tower to a Battered ‘House of Horrors’,1970-01-01 00:33:27.081919,"Deeper down into the building, the floors grew darker where windows had been replaced by plywood panels in advance of dismantling. Here, floors were punctuated with open shafts ringed by wooden barricades.

All the floors visited last week, from 23 to the last vestiges of 27, had already been certified as clear of potentially hazardous contaminants and ready for deconstruction, said Avi Schick, president of the Empire State Development Corporation and chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which owns 130 Liberty Street. That was true of the 20th through 22nd floors, too, he said.

The corporation had expected to have the 18th and 19th floors certified as early as tomorrow.

But it was the 17th floor — off limits to visitors — where the fire was presumed to have begun. That would have presented a dreadful and confusing scene of a much different kind to the firefighters who arrived there on Saturday.

“You think you’re going to open construction floor plates,” Mr. Schick said, “and instead you’re going into a house of horrors.”

The 17th floor was in the midst of being scrubbed, scraped and vacuumed by workers in hazardous-materials suits. Thick plastic barriers lined the walls, cutting down on the light coming in from the windows.

Firefighters would have had to contend with decontamination stations, constructed of plywood, through which workers pass on their way to and from clean floors. These have two or three air-lock chambers, divided by thick plastic curtains.

“You come off the hoist and you immediately confront these series of curtains, like a maze,” Mr. Schick said. “If you go left, it’s a dead end. If you go right, you have to keep opening curtains, one after the other.”

Adding to the problem, he said, were exhaust systems installed on the contained floors to maintain “negative pressure” — that is, they keep the air pressure inside lower than it is outside, so that if the protective barriers develop a leak, contaminated air will not be expelled.

But the exhaust systems would also have brought in outside air that fed the flames and would have drawn smoke across the floors without fully venting it, since their filters are designed to trap particulate matter.

“It might, unfortunately, have been the perfect storm of misfortune,” Mr. Schick said.

A visit two years ago, before the demolition began, found a building in which time stopped on Sept. 11, 2001, and never started again.

Before the interior cleanup and decontamination began in earnest, there were enough traces of Deutsche Bank and of Bankers Trust, which constructed the skyscraper, that one could feel the presence of its occupants.

Smoothie prices were still posted in the fourth-floor cafeteria. Mailbox cubbyholes on the 39th floor were still set aside for P. David, J. Gary, R. Livermore, M. Mongello, F. Rivera and J. Robinson. One of Michael Philipp’s calling cards — “Member of the Board of Managing Directors” — could be spotted on the 34th floor.

No one returned to work at 130 Liberty Street after 9/11. The building was too badly damaged by the collapse of 2 World Trade Center. But as the traces of Deutsche Bank’s hasty, unplanned exit were removed and as the building itself cast a shorter and shorter shadow on ground zero, it seemed as if the awful spell had at last been broken.

But moving from D to D+ still means we need to take tremendous strides to make our cities “smarter.”

Raising our grade to a C isn’t that far out of reach. In fact, we can probably do even better.

The United States has demonstrated an uncanny ability to compete and innovate at high levels despite its often decrepit infrastructure — some pipes and railroads predate the first radio transmission and airplanes. What the civil engineers’ ranking really shows is that the United States has an enormous opportunity to surpass our global competition — succeed at “A” levels in the global economy — if we can just improve our playing field a little more.

So how do we move from near-failing, non-competitive infrastructure to top-of-the-class performance? We unleash our cities to learn, communicate, analyze and improve — just as we expect from our best and brightest thinkers.

As any teacher knows, students learn at different paces. Some need special emphasis to catch up. This same approach applies to making our cities smarter. What San Francisco needs to improve its energy efficiency is probably different than the needs of Denver. Customized approaches are the key to improvement.

That’s why it’s important that the ASCE, for the first time, gave each state its own grade. Collective progress will only happen through individual improvements at the local level. We can drive fundamental change throughout the United States by addressing specifically where each city most requires attention.

True, this can take a great deal of money. But investing in the right technology solutions now can mitigate future challenges and lessen increasing repair costs. More important, it can ultimately ready our cities to excel in today’s population-growth era.

Unlocking each city’s potential is dependent on some key components — namely affordable scalability and interconnectivity:

We need to see today’s high-tech revolution applied across the nation. We need to start installing and using that new technology now to help the greater United States in its own “infrastructure evolution” — one that will drive continued economic competitiveness.

That’s not just doing our homework. That’s being smart.

Eisenhower.

Members of Eisenhower’s family have called Gehry’s design too extravagant. Others object to Gehry’s avant-garde approach, featuring statues of the president and World War II supreme Allied commander in Europe framed by metal tapestries depicting images of his boyhood home in Kansas. The tapestries would be held up by 80-foot-tall columns.

Monuments to Eisenhower and other presidents

Earlier last week, Utah Rep. Rob Bishop introduced legislation calling for a new design competition for the memorial and eliminating $100 million in future funding for the current design.

“Representative Bishop’s legislation allows Congress to exercise governmental authority in a wholly arbitrary manner that negates the stated selection process,” American Institute of Architects CEO Robert Ivy said. “It is nothing more than an effort to intimidate the innovative thinking for which our profession is recognized at home and around the globe.”

Bishop responded that he was inviting more design ideas to create a fitting tribute to Eisenhower, saying: “This bill has nothing to do with influencing the innovative thinking of architects, and everything to do with the responsible management of more than $60 million of taxpayers’ money.”

About 50 protesters gathered at Dolores Park at 5 p.m. and listened to music for an hour before marching down 18th Street, chanting ""Homes not jails."" Shortly after 6 p.m., protesters wearing black masks broke into an empty building at 535 Castro St. and hung a sign reading, ""Gentrification Equals Assimilation.""

About half of the crowd stayed outside the two-story building while about as many police officers gathered across the street. Police stormed the building at about 6:50 p.m. Nearly an hour later, they arrested 20 people inside the building and marched them into a waiting police van. One woman sprained her ankle while trying to run from police as they stormed the building.

Earlier, housing activist Tommy Avicolli Mecca, who was carrying a sign that read, ""Stop the war on the poor,"" said the city needs to do more to make use of its vacant spa-ces.

""In San Francisco we have anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000 homeless people, yet we have all these empty buildings,"" he said. ""Do the math. Why are we not using them? We're the city that thinks outside the box.""

The Castro Street building has retail space on the bottom floor. Upstairs was a residential space that looked like it was under construction, with fresh paint, drywall and refurbished floors. Protesters said the property has been empty for more than five years.

Matt Crain, a 42-year-old self-described homeless squatter, looked admiringly at the empty building and said he wouldn't mind staying there.

""It's pathetic, sad,"" he said. ""My understanding is, it's been vacant for years.""

The protest was planned in conjunction with World Homeless Action Day, which aimed to draw attention to the needs of homeless people around the globe. The San Francisco protest was organized by a local group called Homes Not Jails, which has been working for two decades to allow homeless people to take over vacant and abandoned buildings.

In a news release announ-cing Wednesday's protest, the group said there are 18.5 million vacant homes across the nation and 3.5 million homeless people, and that many homes in San Francisco are kept vacant intentionally, contributing to the city's ""artificially inflated housing prices.""

But a group of onlookers who had gathered to watch the protest had mixed opinions. Some cheered when the police moved in.

Iris Dolowitz, 30, who lives nearby, stood with friends while watching the unfolding drama.

""I'm a little confused as to why these people are in the building,"" she said. ""I would assume the landlord didn't allow them to do that. It's not an abandoned building - it's just empty.""

However, Veronica Ann Hutch, 39, of San Francisco watched with a pained expression.

""I feel bad for them, it's scary being homeless,"" she said. ""But I wouldn't want to be in their shoes, taking over a building like that. That's scary, too.""

Across the bay, about 100 people gathered at 5 p.m. at Snow Park in Oakland to celebrate the first anniversary of the Occupy Oakland encampment. Participants hoisted a banner that read, ""Long live the Oakland commune,"" set up free food lines and cranked up dance music. About a dozen police officers monitored the gathering.

Terrance Jones, 36, of Oakland acknowledged that the movement has lost momentum since last fall, but said he was still proud of bringing the issue of financial inequality into the national discussion. He said he never camped in Frank Ogawa Plaza outside City Hall, but the movement inspired him to become active in local politics.

""It's a good time to remind politicians we're still here and we still want change,"" said Jones, an unemployed laborer.

Scott Olsen, the 25-year-old Marine veteran who made national headlines when he suffered a critical head injury during an Occupy protest last October, said participants ""want to bring people out and rekindle some of those friendships and relationships"" on the local movement's birthday.

""We want people to know this is worth putting their time and energy into,"" he said.

Nearby, construction workers were nailing sheets of plywood over windows at a Kaiser Permanente building, apparently in preparation for possible vandalism. As it got dark, more people arrived, including one man holding a sign that read, ""Stop destroying Oakland."" Last weekend, masked vandals splintered off from a larger antiwar protest march and smashed windows, lobbed paint bombs and spray-painted graffiti on storefronts.

On Wednesday, one black-clad protester tried to explain his rationale for violence: ""If you don't have money, you have people, and if you don't have big numbers of people you make as much noise as possible.""

But the counter-protester remained unpersuaded.

""Making noise is better than breaking windows,"" said the man, who declined to give his name.

Low vacancy, high demand drive office building further skyward

Just when you thought there was no more room for construction cranes in downtown San Francisco, a new crop of office towers is sprouting on the city skyline.

From Mission Bay to the north Financial District, more than 5 million square feet of commercial space is under construction or will be in the next 12 months. That’s more new office space than the city has produced in the previous 15 years combined.

The bullish development is being driven by the usual cocktail of low vacancy and high demand — with a dash of San Francisco politics thrown into the mix, say developers and brokers.

While skyscrapers like 350 Mission St. and 222 Second St. are nearing completion, others are just getting off the ground. At 350 Bush St., backhoes are preparing the site for a 19-story building that will incorporate the historic Mining Exchange next door. At 1800 Owens St. in Mission Bay, Kilroy Realty Corp., which is developing 350 Mission St. for Salesforce and 333 Brannan St. for Dropbox, will start work by April on a 700,000-square-foot, four-building complex that is being marketed as the Exchange.

Already several tenants have looked seriously at pre-leasing space in the Exchange.

“We are pretty far down the road with one tenant,” said Mike Sanford, Kilroy executive vice president. “There are so many users out there. Most tenants we are talking to want half or all of the property. We are looking for the right fit.”

Meanwhile, developers Golub & Co. and the John Buck Co. have already rolled out a marketing campaign for what they are calling the Park Tower at Transbay, a 43-story high-rise planned for a city-owned parcel at Beale and Howard streets near the new Transbay Transit Center. The $44 million land sale for that project, which will break ground early next year, will help pay for the transit center.

The rule of thumb in commercial real estate is that new office construction makes sense when vacancy rates fall below 10 percent.

The vacancy rate in the central business district is now below 8 percent, while some submarkets, such as SoMa, are under 5 percent. The lack of available space has forced fast-growing companies such as Dropbox, Splunk, Uber, Salesforce, Twitter and LinkedIn to lease entire buildings before they are even topped off. Six of the eight buildings that opened in 2014 or will open in 2015 are 100 percent pre-leased.

Even with all the San Francisco companies that have made major commitments, there are plenty of others still on the prowl for corporate headquarters, said Christopher Roeder of commercial broker Jones Lang LaSalle, who is doing the marketing for the Park Tower at Transbay. Roeder counts 14 tenants in the market looking for at least 100,000 square feet, while only seven spaces are large enough to accommodate a tenant of that size.

“I think people are past wondering, by a long shot, whether all the stuff under construction will lease,” said attorney Tony Natsis of the firm Allen Matkins, who negotiated many of the recent large tech leasing deals, including deals for Salesforce, Uber and Dropbox. “We just have too many ass-kicking companies in San Francisco.”

While Jones Lang LaSalle would not identify active tenants looking in San Francisco, sources said they include Stripe, Atlassian, Lyft, Zenefits and Castlight Health. UCSF is also a candidate for the Kilroy complex in Mission Bay.

“I think the market is extremely deep and extremely broad and is continuing to grow,” said Bill Cumbelich of CBRE, whose team is marketing both 350 Bush St. and the Exchange.

Of course, development in San Francisco is hugely expensive — the Park Tower will cost about $690 million — and developers would not be swarming all over the city if they didn’t think they could make a buck or two. Average Class A rents in the city are $67 per square foot, according to CBRE. New construction needs to get an average of $75 or $80 per square foot to make economic sense.

“You can’t build this stuff unless tech companies are willing to pay the freight — and they are,” Natsis said. “Rent is not the fight with these guys. It’s more about delivery timing, about power, about expansion rights, about control over common areas and whether they can their take their dogs to work.”

Developers who are sitting on approved projects are also encouraged by the city’s Proposition M law, which caps the amount of new office space that can be approved each year at 875,000 square feet. With the backlog of projects seeking approval well in excess of what is allowable under the Prop. M cap, developers who have fully entitled projects ready to go are feeling extra confident that regulation will ensure that there won’t be a glut of space.

“Prop. M will start becoming a governor this year, so you don’t need to worry about oversupply,” Sanford said.

San Francisco’s wave of new office buildings is in keeping with other major markets. Seattle has 4.1 million square feet of office space under construction. New York has 5.2 million square feet, while Dallas has 5.2 million square feet. Developers in Houston, notorious for its lax zoning, are putting up more than 15 million square feet of office space.

“It’s extremely important that this space gets built. It’s the only way to keep rents from skyrocketing,” Cumbelich said. “That is where we have gotten into trouble in the past — we run out of space, rents spike, the market gets destabilized, and tenants have to go elsewhere.”

The developer, who has nearly sold out his nearby Linea condo complex, recently submitted plans to put 60-65 apartments on the site and is currently awaiting Planning Department approvals to move forward. Spiers expects the approval process to take 12-18 months, but he thinks he will ultimately be successful in receiving permits to build a modern, seven-story apartment building. “I do think that most people in the Planning Department would welcome 64 units of housing rather than a one-floor restaurant,” he says.

In fact, efforts to put a Chipotle in the location fell through last summer when the Planning Commission would not consent to allowing “formula retail” in the neighborhood. But Spiers says his proposal, with its mix of 40% two-bedroom, 40% one-bedroom and 10% studio apartments, is exactly what the Market & Octavia Neighborhood Plan calls for. It will also have the city-mandated 12% affordable housing.

Plus, since the comfort food restaurant went out of business in 2011, the prime location on the corner of Church, 14th and Market streets has sat empty, putting a blight on an otherwise lively intersection. Spiers thinks those who already live in the neighborhood are likely to support its transformation. “Taking a derelict site and developing it is always positive,” asserts Spiers. “I’m optimistic it will be welcomed by the neighborhood groups.”

In fact, the neighborhood is the prime reason Spiers is interested in developing the site into apartments. Citing the Muni station literally outside its doors, the adjacent Safeway and Whole Foods, and the terrific bars and restaurants in the area, Spiers felt the former restaurant was calling out to become something more. “It’s a really vibrant corner and, with a current one-story structure, it’s a property that really begs to be developed,” he says.

That development plan could include another restaurant. In fact, Spiers says the first floor would be perfect for retail or a restaurant—just probably not a Chipotle. “That would be somewhat out of the question,” he says with a laugh.

A brief response can form an immediate reaction, one that is frustrating and confusing to the recipient.

When you think of rapport it’s usually connected with an interpersonal situation where you carry on a good conversation using both your verbal and non-verbal cues of communicating. It is much easier to tell when a person is actively engaged in a conversation by seeing their reactions and observing their tone. However, communicating through email requires a different set of rapport-building skills.

When employees average up to 120 emails a day, it’s no wonder that email fatigue sets in after a while. Even with the best intentions, rapid fire responses can lead to misunderstandings. The manner in which you answer and respond to emails is often an extension of your communication style.

Brief email responses can easily lead to misinterpretation and give the reader plenty of opportunities to fill in the rest of the story. Keep in mind that while you may feel comfortable replying with a short one-liner response to an employee who took the time to communicate with you, it could be leaving the employee with a dismissive message.

Time is money and the less time spent with emails, the more you have for other tasks. However, it pays to be sensitive toward your communication style especially if you are in a management role. The angst and misunderstanding created by one- or two-word responses can cost a tremendous amount of time in wasted energy by employees or colleagues trying to guess the intention and tone.

Emailing is not the only form of communication that creates misinterpretation; texting and instant messaging are all effective ways to confuse receivers and as time moves on, they will play a greater role in the workplace.

Here are some suggestions for building email rapport: • Observe the style of communication and mimic with your responses. If the sender is brief and concise with his or her content, then respond that way. Matching the sender’s style is a cue worth remembering. • Read the email thoroughly and make sure you answered all the questions asked. The way you respond ultimately leads to building relationships. • Limit the amount of topics and questions in one email; staying with one question has a greater chance of response instead of multiple topics. • With 60 percent of communication being non-verbal, consider what you want to convey without the benefit of weighing the non-verbal cues. • When in doubt while responding to problems, consider picking up the phone and talking through issues that are cumbersome. • Communicating behind a screen can diminish your social skills. A good rule of thumb: If you wouldn’t say your response in person, think twice about emailing it to them.

The headliner of today’s Datebook print column of Inside Scoop is all about Urban Putt, the Mission District’s forthcoming indoor miniature golf course, restaurant and bar.

We’ve mentioned Urban Putt in these parts before; last we checked in with proprietor Steve Fox (who goes by the title of “Head Greenskeeper”), the project on the corner of South Van Ness and 22nd was seeking Kickstarter money (which it got) and seeking city approval (which it got).

Urban Putt is now in full construction swing, with the aim of a mid-April debut — though you know how those moving targets work. Today, we chat with Mr. Fox about the restaurant and bar side of the operation. The big news is that he’s hired a chef to run the 72-seat restaurant upstairs: Dane Boryta, last seen at North Beach’s Bottle Cap. Also, do note that the Bon Vivants (Trick Dog) will do the drinks at both bars , though Urban Putt won’t open with the Type 47 liquor license originally envisioned; they’ll only have a Type 41, which means that there will be no hard liquor.

Below, our chat with Steve Fox:

PL: You’re in the midst of construction. It looks like it’s going fast at this point.

SF: It does, it does. When so much of the work that was going on before this, it felt like nothing was happening. They were working on the roof, the crane came in, the compressors. All this infrastructure stuff where it’s hard to see progress. And now all of a sudden, the progress is just exploding, and it’s great. We also have hired a chef — Dane Boryta — and we’re working with him as we go through the menu ideas.

What about him meshed with you?

First off, when we had him cook for us, he just blew us away. He was great. The primary thing you want in someone who cooks for you is a guy who can cook. He made a whole series of dishes for us, after really talking through what we were trying to accomplish, and he nailed it on every dish. It’s remarkable. I think he innately understood what we were trying to do. He’s calling it Americana cuisine. I think of it as California comfort cuisine with a twist. and he was saying it has a little state fair quality to it. Obviously the food needs to be wonderful, but it also needs a certain cheekiness. Dane’s a guy who understands that.

What are some of the special needs of food at a mini golf course?

We have some individual and specific challenges. When you’re having food, when some of it is served on a mini golf course. for instance, you don’t want to have something really greasy. You can be chomping on some wings and then try to grab a golf club and swing it. That’s a potentially ugly situation.

So you need to come up with stuff that works as a pass-around on a course — and that would include both the drinks and the food. Greasiness is clearly one part of it, but also portability and making sure that there are not different cuisines served in one place and the other. You want a certain cohesiveness and consistency.

Do you have an example of a dish that would work well?

For instance, Dane made these fried olives — not at all greasy, wonderful, and so tasty we were having trouble stopping ourselves from eating them. They’re just perfect, and a kind of dish that can go around the course. He’ll work on many more things. You can certainly imagine stuff on sticks. That can be very strong as far as the cuisine, high quality and delicious — but you don’t have to worry about it slipping off. We’ll do the familiar but very well, with a twist.

In terms of reservations and flow, how will the restaurant and bar function in relation to the golf course?

At least initially, we’re not planning to take reservations for the golf course. You can come in a put your name in there and we’ll have a paging system and we’ll be able to send you a text. At that point, we’ll have a very good idea of how long the wait will be. You can sit at the main bar, you can sit in the clubhouse [Ed. note: an adjacent first-floor lounge], you can go to the bar upstairs, or if there’s a 45-minute or hour wait, you can go up and have a meal. We’re still working out details for the restaurant portion; we will certainly take some number of reservations there, but we want to make sure there’s plenty of room for walk-ins.

It’s important to us that this is a nice combination of neighborhood restaurant as well as a destination, both in terms of pricing and availability. We’re cognizant of that. The neighborhood has been very supportive of us. We’ve had a lot of open door meetings. We’ve brought people in. I want people to feel comfortable coming here and playing mini golf, eating and drinking — whatever they want to do.

What’s not clear to us yet, because it’s impossible to know before we open, is what that most common flow will be. Is it “let’s go get a meal and play mini golf”? Or “let’s play mini gold and have a meal”? It will be interesting to see how those pieces play off one another. We don’t have any historical information. In fact, none exists anywhere in the United States. This is a unique venture, and so it’s really hard to know exactly how those pieces will work.

But you can control certain aspects.

What we can make sure is that we have excellence in whatever we do, from service to food to a unique miniature golf experience. What that means is you’ve got multiple things that people can do — and we can let people use their imaginations as well. This is a place that requires, and encourages, imagination. It’s a place that’s about having fun. You’ll see that as a consistent theme. One of the things we’ll talk about with the servers and everyone else is that this is meant to be a fun place.

How long do you anticipate the course to take to complete? And how many people can be on it at once?

It’s about 40 minutes. You can have about 4 people per hole and there are 14 holes because of space. Traditionally there are 18 holes in a golf course. We originally put 18, but it was too crowded, so we cut the number to 14. We’re going to have a series of additional holes we call “plus-fours” throughout the space. They’re interesting, almost closer to art projects, but still related to mini golf.

Rating: * *

How Much Does Your Building Weigh, Mr Foster? is a handsome portrait of one of the most esteemed architects of the modern age: Norman Foster. It offers up for awe, if not critical inspection, many of the structures with which he has made his name over the last four decades: the Millennium Bridge, the Millau Viaduct in France, 30 St Mary Axe (better known as the 'Erotic Gherkin’), the renovated Reichstag in Berlin, Terminal 3 at Beijing Capital International Airport.

For those of us who will likely never get the opportunity to see most of these buildings at first hand, Norberto Lopez-Amado and Carlos Carcas’s elegantly photographed travelogue is the next best thing. An array of distinguished artists, among them Richard Serra, Anthony Caro and Anish Kapoor, salute the man whom the Pulitzer Prize-winning critic of the New Yorker, Paul Goldberger (also interviewed here), hails as the “Mozart of modernism”. Deyan Sudjic, director of the London Design Museum, wrote the script, and, speaking in an unusually low-key and almost confidential voice, narrates the film, too.

It’s possible that Foster’s athletics and his love of flying are news. His resemblance, in archival footage from the early 1980s, to One Foot In The Grave’s Richard Wilson is certainly surprising. For the most part though, this is a film that reaffirms rather than probes its subject’s brilliance.

What makes some of his buildings better than others, and what are the criteria by which such evaluations might be made? How important are politics to him and what does he think about the accusation that contemporary architects are too silent about the repressive regimes whose nation-building narcissism they facilitate?

It would have interesting if the filmmakers had explored the idea that Foster himself is a corporation; employing hundreds of people all around the world and being, according to Sudjic, “placeless to quite an extraordinary extent”, he sounds very much like a modern, multinational company. Those sorts of questions wouldn’t necessarily diminish Foster, but they might have forced him out his safety zone, a space in which this documentary is happy to see him padding about.","An opportunity to see the life's work of one of the most esteemed architects

It is not often that a story breaks that fundamentally changes the view of a sector in the public's mind. The news that Skipton Building Society has decided to trigger its ""exceptional circumstances"" clause and raise the rate the society charges its mortgage holders from 3.5pc to 4.95pc could be one such moment.

Since the events of 2008 and the credit crisis we have been told time and time again that in the finance sector trust is everything. Well, if you are one of the 64,000 mortgage holders possibly affected by this ""exceptional move"", what are your trust levels in your building society today? You were told when you took out that shiny new mortgage that your standard variable rate would never be more than 3pc above the Bank of England base rate. Until, that is, the building society decides otherwise.

A whole heap of questions now follow. Who decides what is an ""exceptional circumstance""? What is the legal definition? Were mortgage holders clearly told when they took out the mortgage that the society could act in this way? And what does it mean for the building society sector as a whole?

Building societies are supposed to be the ""nicer"" bit of the mortgage and savings sector, not like those rapacious banks blundering around with their ever-cleverer deals and tricks with the housing market.

But with the events of the last 24 hours they will have to work hard to retain that image. What the Skipton move shows us is that building societies have seen their business model wholly broken by two things - fundamental changes in the savings market and the era of ultra-low interest rates set by the Bank of England. Savers are flowing to banks which, desperate to rebuild their capital positions, are offering remarkable rates.

As a country we've always loved building societies - their mutual status somehow fits with our view of the good society. I wonder what mortgage holders at Skipton are thinking, as they are told that their mortgages are going up by as much as £2,000? These are people trying to juggle household commitments in a tough economic climate - did David Cutter, the aptly named chief executive of Skipton - consider them when he announced his handbrake turn?

I look forward to your comments.","Skipton has invoked an 'execeptional clause' that will land thousands of its

In the report, the Bank revealed its concerns about potential writedowns on £200bn of loans made to commercial property by major UK banks. It warned of an increasing number of loan defaults given the 44pc fall in the value of shops, offices and warehouses since 2007.

However, the Bank also described how the approach of the lenders to withdrawing from the property sector could jeopardise the economy's recovery. Their exposures are almost six times greater than in the 1990s recession.

Lenders may be forced into selling a wave of properties as the stock of repossessed assets grows, according to the Bank. This could disrupt the supply-and-demand balance and place ""significant downward pressure"" on recovering property values.

""That would reduce banks' recovery rates and could potentially prompt other banks to sell their assets, leading to further falls in property values,"" the Bank says in the report.

""This would exacerbate problems for commercial property companies and firms in other sectors that have used property as collateral. If this risk was to materialise, it could leave banks less able to supply credit to the wider economy.""

The concern is acknowledged by property bosses, who blame a mass sell-off by the banks of distressed properties for the severity and length of the property crash in the early 1990s.

Lengthy talks have been held between property companies and banks, notably Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, about joint ventures or the sales of properties where the loan has defaulted.

But so far the banks have preferred to keep hold of most of their distressed assets while analysing their worth and planning how to increase their value.

Lenders have avoided repossessions on many facilities where the loan-to-value covenant has been breached because interest payments are still being met. Also, in some instances, lenders have not even demanded the revaluation of properties because the loan is still performing.

However, according to the Bank of England, this policy may have to be reconsidered as declines in rents and increases in the number of empty properties threatens the income of landlords, meaning loans cannot be serviced.

Dubai's construction boom has been wiped out by the recession

The Association for Consulting and Engineering (ACE) said some members have been offered just 65 cents on the dollar on unpaid fees by the emirate's best-known developer, Nakheel.

Nakheel, which has built palm-shaped islands in the Gulf and has plans for the world's first kilometre-high tower, is dealing with a debt crisis caused by the collapse in the property market following the credit crunch.

After a visit to Dubai, ACE's chief executive, Nelson Ogunshakin, described the situation as ""chaos"". He has written to Lord Mandelson, the Business Secretary, to ask for political intervention. The most important developers in the United Arab Emirates, including Nakheel, are part of holding companies owned either by the governments or rulers of the federation's seven emirates, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

""There remain a number of serious concerns, namely a staggering amount of unpaid fees, which our soundings indicate are around £400m,"" he said. ""There is also a growing sense of mistrust in the UAE, and it looks set to worsen through episodes like this.""

Although just one of a number of developers selling villas and apartments across Dubai, it was Nakheel's extraordinary showpiece ventures that captured the international imagination.

This week, though, Nakheel admitted it had been forced to accept money from a $10bn (£6.6bn) bond raised by the Dubai authorities to bail out government-linked companies. It also has to refinance a $3.5bn Islamic bond due in November.

Analysts said it was trying to avoid a wholesale restructuring as any debt default would hit not only its own reputation but also the credit ratings of other government-backed companies.

Bobby Sarkar, an analyst at Al Mal Capital in Dubai, said it was unclear whether the 35pc discount being demanded of contractors was across the board. ""Obviously this does affect confidence,"" he said. ""People aren't going to be willing to do more business if they are only going to get 65 to 70 cents on the dollar.""

A spokesman for Nakheel said it was acting ""responsibly"" to reassess its immediate business objectives.

""We are in discussions with all our key suppliers and contractors to help secure jobs and ensure that projects are on track,"" the spokesman said. ""We have benefited from an injection of capital from the bond issue. The value and other details relating to this funding remain confidential.""","Builders and engineers responsible for the luxury developments that turned 
  Dubai into a desert boom town have called on the British government to help

Some commentators, such as our Property Clinic expert David Snell, reckon times have rarely been better for the self-builder. Says Snell: ""Both land prices and construction costs are falling, creating a benign environment for people who want to build an individual home.""

Marcus and Yvonne Copeland are building a contemporary-style home partially built into a hillside in north-west Wales. Despite the current state of the housing market they decided to continue with the £450,000 project because rather than being a speculative venture, they want it to be their long-term home.

""This is our dream home and we intend to live here for the foreseeable future. On that basis, the decision to build now rather than wait for the market to recover was the right one,"" says Marcus, a mortgage adviser.

""The savings we have made in this current competitive climate has helped knock thousands off the cost of materials and labour.

""Once completed, we expect our home to be worth at least 25 per cent more than we have spent,"" says Marcus.

Plotfinder.net, the online database of land and renovation opportunities, reports that subscriptions to their land-finding service have increased dramatically in January and February.

""Plot prices have fallen by at least 20-30 per cent and there is far more choice now. We have a record number of listings with almost 7,800 sites available for sale across the UK,"" says plotfinder.net's Vicky Baylis.

""We have seen a surge in interest in self-build this year,"" says John Day, head of financial services, marketing, at Buildstore, the specialist self-build lender. ""The market has changed since the onset of the credit crunch, but it is still buoyant and money is still available.

""Lenders still see self-builders as a relatively good risk because of the equity built into such projects. The end value of a project is typically 20-25 per cent above the build cost.""

In Birmingham this week, the National Homebuilding & Renovating Show brings together more than 500 exhibitors including architects, design-and-build package companies, materials suppliers, specialist lenders and land-finding companies.

Increased interest in sustainable homebuilding is reflected in a dedicated Eco Homes Show, where the latest ideas on creating self-sufficient, low- impact homes will be on display, as well as products to make existing housing more energy-efficient and ecological.

Renovators and home improvers will also find all the information they need for an extension, remodelling or loft conversion project.","Plot prices have fallen by at least 20-30 per cent and there is far more

Highbridge Capital Management, which is majority owned by JP Morgan Chase and has $25bn under management, is axing 10 per cent of its New York-based staff and plans cuts in Europe and Asia.

The volatility in global stock markets has savaged the performance of some of the world’s best-known hedge funds, raising fears of a collapse in the sector, which could cause a fresh crisis in the financial system.

Big names including Deephaven, Marshall Wace, Citadel Investment Corp, Lansdowne Partners, Third Point and Harbinger, have in recent weeks sustained losses of as much as 20 per cent in some funds.

Investors pulled at least $43bn (£25bn) from US hedge funds in September, according to TrimTabs Investment Research. This is nearly five per cent of the global sector’s estimated $2 trillion in total assets.

Part of the fall in share prices around the world is the result of hedge funds having to liquidate positions to fund redemptions as investors flee the asset class. Last week, Manny Roman, the co-chief executive of GLG, Europe’s biggest hedge fund, warned that thousands of hedge funds are on the brink of failure. He predicted that between 25 and 30pc of the world’s 8,000 hedge funds would disappear “in a Darwinian process’’, either by going bust or deciding that meagre returns are not worth their efforts.

Insiders said Highbridge management planned the restructuring to cope with the turbulence in the hedge fund industry. Highbridge executives are also keen to position the firm to take advantage of cheap European stocks amid the collapse in equity markets.

Highbridge has hired Munib Islam, a senior fund manager from Third Point Capital, one of New York’s best-known and most aggressive hedge funds, to head a new European operation which will buy into over-sold companies across the Continent. Michael Alsalem, a fund manager from Kingdon Capital Management, another rival, has been hired to work with him.

The fund will be Highbridge’s first dedicated to European equities. Until now, its presence in London has focused on researching investments for its US-based funds.

Highbridge, whose sale to JP Morgan in 2004 was one of the first and most lucrative examples of investment banks buying into hedge funds, has dominated the sector. At its peak, the firm had an estimated 20 separate funds with $35bn under management.

Two years ago, Highbridge hired the former co-head of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, Scott Kapnick, to lead its move into private equity and corporate debt.

But, as with other funds, Highbridge has suffered from the financial crisis. Among the group’s funds, its multi-strategy fund declined about 13pc this year at the end of September, while its long-short fund was down about 6pc. Its statistical arbitrage fund is up about 8pc.","The world’s biggest hedge fund is undertaking a radical restructuring amid a

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/property-and-architecture/79428/best-luxury-swimming-pools.html,https://web.archive.org/web/2015072919id_/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/property-and-architecture/79428/best-luxury-swimming-pools.html,Get in the swim - Telegraph,1970-01-01 00:33:35.072919,"It’s rare that the urban wasteland behind King’s Cross is credited with encouraging us to embrace nature. But the recent opening of the country’s biggest open-air swimming pond there – a 40-metre long chemical-free pool surrounded by wild flowers and grasses – is driving a surge in demand for similarly bucolic pools in our back gardens.

Forget swimming among the murky depths of Hampstead ponds, where you never know what slippery creatures might be sharing your dip. Swimming ponds have crystal clear water and the bathing area is separate from the beasties.

“When you’re planning to build a swimming pond, you need to decide how big an area you want to swim in, then double it to account for the surrounding planting,” says Paul Mercer, director of The Swimming Pond Company, who is currently working on a natural swimming pool in Suffolk whose water laps up to the edge of the new-build eco house.

“You open the fully-glazed walls of the master bedroom and walk straight onto the stepping stones,” says Mercer. This particular pool is costing £180,000 to build, but Mercer reckons to budget from £50,000 for an 80m2 swimming pond. You can enjoy the natural experience in small, urban spaces too. Clear Water Revival – who have seen demand for natural pools rise by 80 per cent in the past year – say a 15m2 natural plunge pool would cost from £15,000.

Existing ponds or conventional pools can be converted into swimming ponds – or you can build from scratch – and there are great benefits. Swimming ponds – where plants keep the water clean by removing its nutrients – don’t need covering over when summer’s over and you can’t heat them so they’re cheap to maintain. “The biggest job of the year is cutting back the plants in November,” says Mercer.

Natural pools – where the water is cleaned by a biological filter – can be heated and covered, “just like a chlorinated pool. You can still include plants in your pool design but cleverly separate them from the swimming area,” says Kate Hawkins from Clear Water Revival.

Unlike traditional swimming pools, which spell endless maintenance to many prospective buyers, natural pools are more likely to recoup their cost and potentially add to the property’s overall value and desirability.

“They are still uncommon, which makes it difficult to determine their value, and their worth is definitely in the eye of the beholder. But for someone who really wants a swimming pool, it could add significant value. There’s something rather romantic about swimming in a natural environment,” comments Lindsay Cuthill, head of Savills Country Department, who is marketing Glen House near Tonbridge in Kent for £4.5m, a Grade II-listed Arts and Crafts house with 10.5 acres of land that include a natural swimming pool.

“Once you’ve had a swimming pond, you can’t live without one,” says Paul Mercer, who swims in his every day. “I’m looking at it now – there are dragonflies and swallows hovering over the water and butterflies in the border beyond. It’s full of life all the time and even in the middle of winter, a swimming pond can look quite magical.”

The Austrians and Germans would agree – they love their natural swimming ponds – but elsewhere in the world, the super-rich have a different view on what makes for a magical swim.

Often that means as much high-tech gadgetery and architectural pizzazzery as possible and one house that delivers both is Villa Escarpa on the Algarve. On sale for €3.7m (fineandcountry.com), its living space floats on an eight-metre wide overhang and the pool cuts through the centre of the u-shaped building and hangs above the valley beyond.

Never a place to stint on bling, Sardinia’s Costa Smeralda is home to a pool that inspired a Bond baddie’s shark pit. Villa Amoras - on sale for €15m (beauchamp.co.uk) – was the prototype of the villain’s house in The Spy Who Loved Me. And the swimming pool – which, in the film, was full of sharks – runs outside and in, beneath the glass floor of the living room. While your partner is relaxing on the sofa, you can demonstrate your backstroke beneath their feet.

In Cannes, a pool is simply about showing off. Inspired by Palladio, there’s a Venetian-style ""palais"" on sale for €95m (john-taylor.com) that appears to float on water, the columned mansion framed by a 25m swimming pool and private lake. And why bother with the Croisette when you can recline on your lilo and watch movies in the swimming pool of The One, a newly-built four-bed villa with a cinema screen at one end of the long infinity pool. That pleasure will cost you €8.45m (home-hunts.com).

“On the French Riviera, pools are also often designed as an extension of the property’s architecture and décor with opulent mirrored infinity pools and Jacuzzis bedecked in marble and onyx,” comments Julien Mendjisky from John Taylor France. “There’s also a trend here for the swimming corridor, where you exercise by swimming against a current,” Mendjisky adds.

Some private villas also have the kind of huge freeform pool you associate with a large luxury resort. In the Maldives, Villa 11 – on sale for $15 million (akinternationalestates.com) – has the biggest freeform pool in the Indian Ocean, all 6,500 sq ft of it with a sunken lounge area and over-water trampoline accessed by a bridge and waterslide.

And in New Jersey, the owners of one modern mansion – yours for $4.199m (dianeturton.com) – commissioned the pool design team from Orlando’s Disney Resort to design their Olympic-sized, freeform novelty with a beach-style entry, grotto, water slides and a water park-style ""lazy river"" attraction.

Some pools come with architectural cachet such as the one at John Lautner’s Stevens’ House, built in 1968, in Malibu. The beachfront wood and concrete house, priced at $19.75m (knightfrank.com), was designed to resemble waves and includes a pool in a hull-shaped room with uninterrupted ocean views.

In La Jolla, San Diego, architect Wallace Cunningham was inspired by Japanese landscapes when he designed Brushstroke – priced at $12.7m (christiesrealestate.com) - with a black, rimless pool shaped like a cat’s eye, whose water cascades 14 feet down into the surrounding gardens.

They’re gorgeous and glitzy, but it could be a while before the billionaires of Cannes or California embrace natural swimming. Then again, they’ve done it in King’s Cross…","Should you opt for an opulent mirrored infinity pool, swimming corridor or natural pond?

The newly finished structure is by the Spanish architects José Selgas and Lucía Cano, a husband-and-wife team who are known for using exuberant colour in their work as well as lightweight materials. Their first project in London was completed late last year – Second Home, an office space for temporary occupation by restless creatives – and the barrel-shaped yellow Perspex roof that tops its street front café has already become an East End landmark. Now they have landed with a puff of ETFE in the more glamorous purlieus of Kensington Gardens.

ETFE is a super-thin, ultra-light material used in architecture for big roof spans (the Beijing Olympic pool, for example) and is rarely close enough to touch. Here, though, it forms the pavilion walls, sometimes in sheet form, sometimes as brightly coloured ribbons that criss-cross between the structural steel poles. “The whole thing is an experiment in what this material can do,” says Jose Canas. “It’s got particular qualities – it’s fire-resistant, it doesn’t tear and it lasts forever – but for us, the important thing was its lightness and foldability. This pavilion is temporary. When it’s time to pack it up, we can do that easily and take it somewhere else. This is just the start of its journey.” The most permanent-seeming part of the project is a white resin floor that becomes awash with rainbow colours when the sun shines (though it was more awash with dirty footprints on the rainy opening morning).

The architects, whose own studio is in a semi-buried bunker in the countryside outside of Madrid, got to know London while working on Second Home. “We like the way the Underground brings everyone together – it’s a place where all kinds of people congregate,” says Jose Salgas. “We wanted to bring that feeling here, so we’ve created a very open space with lots of entry points and it’s up to you to find your corner.”

If my experience is typical, then I’d advise visitors to take their time. The first sense of the pavilion is of a flimsy plastic pastel world, albeit one containing a muscular series of internal twists and turns. But after a while, you become aware of continually changing colours and reflections, the shimmer of the mirrored walls, the multiple openings that frame parts of the park. And then it’s a delight; just not an instant one.",Husband-and-wife architects José Selgas and Lucía Cano bring their exuberantly coloured vision to London's Serpentine Gallery,26.0,0.8571428571,3.3333333333,medium,medium,mixed,architecture

Sandwiched between a busy highway, the High Line (an old elevated train track that has been turned into a green walkway and public park) and the few remaining cold-storage facilities that gave Manhattan’s Meatpacking District its name, the new home for the Whitney Museum of American Art is not a landmark that instantly pleases the eye. All awkward angles and irregular shapes, it is given some harmony by pale ribs of steel cladding and planes of smooth concrete blocks, but in a line-up of great contemporary buildings – or even of Piano’s best buildings – it would definitely be the wallflower, judged from the outside. Which is fine, because in this case, it really is what’s inside that counts.

Talking to me on the phone from his office in Genoa the week before its opening, Piano described the nine-floor $422 million building as ‘a machine for art’, and it is from the inside that you really start to appreciate the huge, light-filled temple to creativity he has made.

""The building was conceived primarily to provide artists with inspirational spaces, to imagine what they can possibly do here,"" the museum’s director, Adam Weinberg, said on the opening day last month. ""It offers us opportunities that we’ve never had before: larger, more flexible galleries in which to show art; outdoor terraces for performance and sculptures; theatres for lectures, performances, panels, installations. I want to salute Renzo Piano for designing this building from the inside out as much as the outside in, putting art and the artists first.""

Piano and his team have positioned windows to provide stunning views across the Hudson river towards New Jersey from the upper floors, with equally panoramic views over Manhattan on the opposite side. There are also side vistas down towards the glittering new Freedom Tower and the Statue of Liberty, and outdoor spaces that help tie the museum to the surrounding area. Performances on the roomy third-floor terrace, for instance, will be easily seen and heard both from the High Line one storey below it, and from the street below that.

It is at street level that you best appreciate how beautifully the building has been designed to fit the site. It shrinks to half the size of the upper storeys, its walls all floor-to-ceiling glass. This lobby will be free to enter, allowing passers-by to use the restaurant or shop and view the art on display here. But what Piano has also done is create a public square between the museum and the steps leading up to the High Line, widening a previously narrow street to open up glorious new views of the water.

Piano famously has no fixed style, designing according to the site and the purpose of the building, but creating new public spaces has always been central to his work. That is why his biggest London building, the Shard, is so surprising. It dominates the capital’s skyline while remaining inaccessible to most Londoners: only the elite can afford to stay in its expensive hotel rooms and dine in its upmarket restaurants; it costs £30 even to enjoy the views from the top. When I say this, he insists I shouldn’t judge until the project – which includes the redevelopment of the busy London Bridge railway station and its surrounding area – is complete.

""We are still working on the station,"" he explains. ""It will be another two or three years. We wanted the building not to touch ground, so that it doesn’t take the land selfishly, and the land is given back to the community in some way. I think this is part of the story.""

Piano was born in the Italian port of Genoa to a builder father. His breakthrough as an architect came in 1971, when he won a competition to design a new arts hub in Paris with his then partner, Richard Rogers. The inside-out design of the Pompidou Centre, with its elevators and utilities all visible on the exterior, caused a stir when it opened in 1977, establishing the duo as the new bad boys of architecture.

He laughs when I point out that he is now part of the establishment, entrusted with huge projects such as a new campus for Columbia University in New York, a film museum for Los Angeles, a national library for Greece and a palais de justice in the suburbs of Paris, as well as major projects across China and India. Rogers has become a lord, and Piano has been honoured in Italy with the similarly lofty title of senator, and although they no longer work together, the two men have remained friends.

""Not long ago, I had a conference with Richard in London,"" Piano says. ""The two old bad boys, together again. It was really funny: him a lord, me a senator. But I still feel the same. I refuse to believe I am 77!""

Architects tend to start their best work at a point when many other professionals are coming to the end of their careers, and Piano is busier than ever, dividing his month between his offices in Genoa, New York and Paris – where his second wife and younger children live. He has four children, ranging in age from 15 to 50. He considers his buildings to be like family too, and says he likes to check in on them. He lives close to the Pompidou Centre, and still pops in regularly.

""I go there every month, for lunch or just to visit,"" he says. ""It’s about affection. You have to see whether they are happy or not. I’m not romantic, but it is true that when you finish a building you hope for it exactly what you hope for with your children. You hope the building will be happy. Which means making people happy.""

Retirement isn’t something he ever considers, he insists. ""Why should I? I enjoy it. This is the only thing I can do, and I can’t stop. It’s such a complicated profession that it takes a long time to learn. So for the first 60 years, you are learning. Then you should have another 60 years to work. But that’s a bit difficult.""

At the opening, Piano declared in a generous, witty speech that ""it takes a thousand people to make a building"". Leading that number is Elisabetta Trezzani, the partner in Renzo Piano Building Works who heads the New York office, just opposite the Whitney. She started work on the museum project in 2005, when its board was already battered by numerous unsuccessful attempts to extend their existing building further uptown. She was there through the selection of the site and the 2009 recession that almost derailed the project, and finally oversaw the building work.

I had assumed the biggest challenge her team faced was the massive fifth-floor gallery, offering the largest display space in New York without a single interrupting column. She says that is not so difficult with good engineers and enough money. For her, the biggest technical challenge was the steel cladding, made of panels 8mm thick and up to 22m tall, some of them curved and twisted to fit the building. Only one company, in Germany, was able to manufacture them. Then special containers had to be made to ship them over and a machine designed to hold them straight while they were fitted to the sides of the building, to give it a distinctive ribbed look. Watching from the window of her office while the panels were hoisted into place – twisting and buckling in the wind – was, she says with a laugh, one of the more heart-stopping moments.

It was Trezzani who took the call when the Italian fashion house MaxMara, which was sponsoring the opening party, rang with a strange request. Would Renzo Piano Building Works like to design a handbag with them, to celebrate the museum’s opening? At first Trezzani and Piano were hesitant.

""We’ve never done anything like that, so we didn’t know how to do it,"" Trezzani says. ""But then we thought it was the kind of special project we would probably never do again. So we said, if we do it, we want it to be a collaboration because we need your expertise, and we can try to pick out the elements of the Whitney that we think could be an inspiration for the bag."" She smiles. ""Also, me being a woman probably helped a little bit, because Renzo only had a general idea, at the beginning, what a bag for a woman needed to be!""

They eventually decided to echo the Whitney’s steel ribbing on the sides of the handbag, only in leather. ""We wanted to do something very detailed and well done, and MaxMara were great to work with. It was fun for me,"" Trezzani adds.

MaxMara’s relationship with the Whitney goes back way before the new building was conceived. The company’s founder, Achille Maramotti, was a keen collector of art, a passion shared by his son Luigi, who is now the company’s chairman. Luigi lived in New York during the 1970s and 1980s, and over the years ties had been strengthened as the Maramotti family lent pieces from their collection for Whitney shows, or helped with fundraising events. So when the museum called to ask them to sponsor the opening-night party, they agreed immediately, especially as the project also involved Italy’s greatest architect. ""It was the perfect storm for us,"" Maramotti says. ""It made sense.""

Fashion, he says, is always exploring ideas about society, about modernity, pushing at the borders of what is acceptable. ""But artists are doing that first, and probably better than fashion designers. We ultimately have to make something that somebody will buy and wear, but for an artist it’s different. It’s a necessity to express himself, and he would do it anyway, even if there were no buyers.""

Like many big names in architecture, Piano has crossed paths with the fashion business before, designing a flagship store for Hermès in Tokyo in the 1980s that still looks glitteringly impressive today. For him, the main difference between his industry and the fashion world is speed.

""What is great about fashion is that it reflects the moment. It’s like taking a picture of a moment,"" he says. ""Fashion relies on the short-term. Architecture is long-term. It’s about cities, longevity. That’s why architects need time to be accepted, to be loved. It’s not instant. Architecture often becomes loved when it is adopted by the city – when you go to the church, to the theatre, the university, the concert hall and it becomes part of your daily life. The great thing about fashion is that it is fun, an expression of joy, instant and ephemeral.""

MaxMara, however, doesn’t really focus on the ephemeral. Its hallmark is timeless classics, pieces that will last and remain stylish, that can be passed from mother to daughter. The label’s creative director is Ian Griffiths, a genial Briton who has worked with the family for 27 years. He talks about the Whitney bag as a future classic, something he hopes the brand will still be making in 20 years’ time.

It is easy to believe he is right. A limited edition of 250 in the same pale grey as the museum’s steel exterior sold out on the first day, but it is a striking, elegant bag in any colour – boxy in shape and roomy enough for all your daily needs without being weighted down by heavy hardware that makes it impossible to carry that long. The Whitney’s ribbing is represented as pintucks in the leather, which posed a challenge for the label’s leather workshop.

""The pintucks were extremely difficult,"" Griffiths says. ""And this is where working with an Italian company is so great. Our craftsmen in Tuscany use techniques that have been perfected over generations, but they are also very open to new ideas.""

Just before the museum opened its first show in the new building to the public, I was given a private tour with Griffiths and a handful of other journalists. The result of three years of discussion among the curatorial team, America Is Hard To See is an unflinching and intellectually rigorous survey of 115 years of American art. It is also full of surprises, juxtaposing familiar pieces by renowned artists with less well-known works.

Many of the choices are brave – a large, bold piece by Donald Moffett attacking President Reagan’s failure to recognise the Aids epidemic, for instance, or a collection of harrowing works depicting lynchings. ""I don’t think there can be many institutions that would be prepared to be so direct about an issue like that,"" Griffiths says. ""It explores facets of the American psyche as you would a person, and in any personality there are good and bad aspects.""

His pre-fall collection for MaxMara is all Whitney-inspired, coming out of conversations with the head curator, Donna De Salvo. ""I didn’t just want to start from a piece of art that was in the collection. What are you going to get out of that – scarves with a print inspired by Jasper Johns? It seems a bit shallow and random.""

Instead, he read the American artist and intellectual Robert Smithson’s musings on memory, which led him to research the rich artistic and cultural history of the area around the museum, including his own memories of visiting the Roxy, a club that in the late 1970s and early 1980s was a playground for artists such as Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, as well as the singers Debbie Harry and Madonna.

He also read Smithson’s thoughts on urban entropy, the idea that, inevitably, an urban space will degenerate back into a natural state. He connected this to the growing trend for rewilding and the creation of the High Line. Then he saw a 2008 installation by Fritz Haeg in the Whitney’s archive representing the return of animals that once would have lived in Manhattan such as the bald eagle, the barn owl and the eastern mud turtle – which, in turn, led to bold animal prints in his collection.

Given all of this, it is probably no surprise that Griffiths is also a professor, teaching fashion at Kingston University in London. At the age of 18, he thought he wanted to be an architect and did a year of study before he realised it wasn’t for him and switched to a fashion course. Still, he stayed in touch with friends he made in that year, most of whom qualified as architects. ""I met up with some of them last weekend,"" he says. ""I said, OK, you completed the course and I didn’t. But which of us is working with Renzo Piano?""

Do you try desperately to banish all thoughts of Hugh Hefner as you suppress an embarrassed British snigger at the sight of one? Are you Scandinavian at heart and think how bracing it would be to streak across the terrace on a snowy winter’s morning and jump into the bubbles? Or is there a touch of the SoCal about you and the mere glimpse of a hot tub sees you planning your ""bellini and bikini"" parties. If so, you’ll be wanting the Luxema 800, the deluxe $26,000 split-level variety that includes a built-in bar, TV and sound system.

Whatever your view on hot tubs, one thing seems certain – the London skyline will soon be peppered with the jet-set waving to one another from their steamy, bubbling rooftop pools as top-end developers include them as must-have accessory for residents of the capital’s multi-million pound penthouses.

Paddington Basin may not match Miami for dreamy waterfront views, but buyers of the duplex penthouses at 3 Merchant Square – priced from £3.4m (020 7993 7393) – can gaze across W2’s canals from the hot tub on their huge decked terrace. The view is more bucolic – you could even watch the Oxford v Cambridge boat race glide by – from the four penthouses at Queen’s Wharf next to Hammersmith Bridge. “The hot tub is a great piece of added luxury. They bring that element of prestige,” says Alex Greaves, CBRE’s associate director of residential development, who is marketing the penthouses from £4.75m (0207 205 2973).

Other high-end London developments with rooftop tubs are 127 Shoreditch, whose £4.75m penthouse (020 7101 2020, hattonrealestate.co.uk) has one on its wraparound terrace. Definitely one for those who want to be seen.

Buyers of the £8.5m Triplex Penthouse or the £8m Ophelia Penthouse at One Tower Bridge (020 7871 0011) can luxuriate in theirs while soaking up the postcard views. “We wanted to create a usable yet luxurious outdoor space which feels like a private members club and hot tubs make the ultimate viewing platform all year round,” comments Jacob Sullivan, Berkeley Homes (South East London) head of sales. “They are certainly the most relaxing way to enjoy panoramic views of the London skyline.”

We British are clearly learning to love a hot tub. Holiday Lettings report that they are one of the most asked-for features in luxury UK holiday homes, with searches for hot tubs in country houses or “swanky flats” rising by 250 per cent in December 2014 compared with a year before.

“They are definitely a tick box for the international super rich and some houses have two – one inside next to the swimming pool as a built-in spa, and one outside as a ""feature"" area,” comments Alex Newall from property advisors Hanover Private Office. There’s something quite sexy and decadent (not to mention exhibitionist, given the probable proximity of your neighbours) about having a hot tub in the city – wallowing in your warm water high above the masses trampling the pavements below.

In semi-rural surroundings such as on Surrey’s Wentworth Estate, where Vilebrequin-toting owners are very partial to these millionaires’ pleasure troughs, it’s all about soaking up the peaceful views across golfing greens and countryside. “We recently acquired a £10m property there for a high profile client which has a sliding glass roof and stairs leading up to a private terrace with a hot tub, wet bar and modern shower,” says Newall. “There’s no escaping it – we’re embracing the American lifestyle.”

Other agents remain unconvinced that we can ever do hot tub culture with aplomb. “They are expensive to maintain, unattractive and frankly still have a bit of a seedy image,” says Robert Bailey, a central London buying agent. “Developers put them in thinking it will entice buyers, but within a few years they are covered in dust and debris, never having been used.”

Jo Eccles, head of Sourcing Property is similarly scathing. “They’re a gimmick that doesn’t get used”, she says, while Camilla Dell, MD of Black Brick buying agency, thinks “they are out of fashion. People prefer to bathe in the privacy of an indoor spa – though they do work well in the country”.

Perhaps they might be converts if they saw the ""hot tug"" – the world’s first wood-fired hot tub that is half Jacuzzi, half motorised dinghy. Ideal for those whose property comes with a mooring. You can’t help thinking that pootling around on the water in a receptacle that is full of water can only lead to a sinking sensation. But the Dutch love them and it can only be a matter of time before they start to appear in St Katherine’s Dock or Chelsea Harbour.","Hot tubs are the latest must-have accessory for residents of London's luxury penthouses, but not everyone's ready to join the party",36.7307692308,0.7307692308,2.5,high,low,mixed,architecture

Jewels with architectural ambitions and sculptural forms are the ideal antidote. Just looking at these sweeping, clean planes of gold inspires serenity and contemplation: just what is needed to start the New Year with a clear head.

Ute Decker is the first name that comes to mind when the words sculptural and jewellery come together, making this something of a speciality of hers. She creates jewels that look just as striking sitting on a museum-style black block of wood as they do on the body. Adding to their appeal, Decker’s jewels come with a clean conscience, as she is adamant about the sustainability and ethics of her materials. Decker, born in Germany but now resident in London, was one of the first jewellers to use Fairtrade gold and uses recycled metals wherever possible.

On the other side of the world, Kuwaiti Alanood Al Sabah trained as an architect before setting her sights on smaller scale creations under the Octium brand she founded with her husband in 2009. Exploring the seemingly infinite possibilities of the octagon, Octium’s jewels suggest modernity and purity in one neat shape.

The new Tiffany T collection provided resounding confirmation that minimalism and strong shapes are in. Clear as a bell, these bracelets, rings and chains play with the T shape – as in T for Tiffany. Tight, taut, disciplined lines make for a dramatic jewellery statement with absolutely no frills.

Sculptural forms invite experimentation and British artist jeweller Jo McDonald ventures into the land of china with her Porcelain collection. McDonald forms unglazed white and coral porcelain into shapes so clean you could eat your dinner off them.

Sarah Herriot, formerly a computer software designer, is another exponent of pared down lines. Using CAD design, she is able to generate complex shapes that she then recreates in precious metals, with intriguing results. I could gaze at that spiral in Zen-like contemplation for a long time.

Another Goldsmiths Fair jeweller is Tom Rucker, whose work is the result of hours of painstaking graft behind a microscope, laser welder in hand. Rucker creates light-as-air orbs out of fine lengths of platinum and gold to create jewels with an otherworldly appeal. Rucker’s forms are so striking that it is a shame to hide them in your jewellery box. So put aside for a moment the sparkles and the excitement, and take time to contemplate a calmer take on adornment that may even be good for the soul.",Maria Doulton cleanses her New Year palate with striking sculptural jewels,44.3636363636,0.6363636364,0.8181818182,high,low,abstractive,architecture

The Leadenhall Building, London: RHSP

If 2013 belonged to The Shard, Renzo Piano’s glass spectacle that soars a record-breaking, for London, 306 metres, then 2014’s skyscraper of the year is a slightly smaller affair at 224 metres. The Leadenhall Building – better known as the Cheesegrater thanks to its triangular form – is the ultimate realization of Richard Rogers’ high-tech principles, here applied to a truly contemporary building. Part of its lofty entrance space offers a new public plaza to the City, while its parking provision –22 cars, 400 bicycles,130 motorbikes – is its view on sustainability writ large.

2. LVMH Foundation, Paris: Frank Gehry. Pathé Foundation, Paris: Renzo Piano

The LVMH Foundation opened in Paris’s Bois de Boulogne in October with the sort of fanfare we’ve come to expect from both a Louis Vuitton project and a Frank Gehry building. But there’s no denying that this is architecture as an event, or an explosion: a cluster of pearly white volumes submersed beneath a flurry of 12 massive glass sails. The terraces beneath these transparent shelters feel like an adult playground, ripe for exploration, and from which splendid views of Paris are revealed.

A couple of arrondisement towards the middle of town, Renzo Piano’s Jerome Seydoux Pathé Foundation opened in September – a stunning curve of glass inserted between two historic buildings, with the hushed charm of the silent films that will be shown in its new cinema space.

3. Aspen Art Museum, Aspen. Shigeru Ban

This was the year that the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban received the Pritzker Prize (architecture’s most significant award) and saw his first building open in the United States, in the less likely location of Aspen, the Colorado ski resort much loved by the upper-most layer of the one per cent.

What appears to be a simple box clad in a woven wooden slats (actually a series of six galleries), its piece de resistance is the roof top sculpture garden which offers incomparable views of Aspen’s ski slopes and 12,000ft Independence Pass. Even from inside the building, the surrounding mountains are continually framed: Ban’s acknowledgement perhaps that the museum might be about displaying art, but the nature outside is pretty hard to beat.

4. Faena House, Miami: Foster + Partners.

Developer-led residential towers from the last decade hog Miami’s ocean views, but one new specimen, which will be occupied from March 2015, has raised the architectural bar. Foster + Partners’ Faena House – named for its developer, the art-loving Argentinian Alan Faena – looks like an ocean liner with its sweeping streamlined balconies. The balconies, large enough to function as outdoor living spaces, also suggest that Faena House dwellers are going to rely more on natural breezes than old Miami’s love of ice-cold air-conditioning.

Surrounded by lush landscaping by Miami resident, the aptly named Raymond Jungles, and with an entrance hall lined in black polished concrete and filled with water pools, it’s perhaps no surprise that Faena House’s triplex penthouse has broken local real estate records, selling for a reported $50million.

5. House of 8 Courtyards, Cuernavaca: Goko Architects

Much Mexican living may take place outside, but even by that consideration, eight courtyards is still an impressive number for one house. This one, in Cuernavaca, starts with a small enclosed pond at its centre from which subsequent living spaces fan out, with nature prioritised at every turn – here a sensationally green lawn, there a jazzy bougainvillea garden, or a restful orchard. Walls and floors are in travertine, paint work is white, light is often filtered through pergolas and though there is a minimum of furniture, this is one maximal expression of spacious living.

6. Island Pavilion, Oxfordshire: Robin Snell and Partners.

If you’ve ever been burdened with the problem of where to put the Jeff Koons, then here’s the answer – in the heart of the Oxfordshire countryside. This summer, a new pavilion was created in the centre of an artificial lake in the grounds of Wormsley, the estate acquired by John Paul Getty in 1984 and now the home of his son Mark.

The pavilion, a dainty building in steel and glass, is a modernist take on the 18th-century originals of the form. This one, however, has an added twist, with the metallic blue Koons’ “Cracked Egg” cleverly embedded in its transparent side.","From the LVMH Foundation to Aspen Art Museum, Caroline Roux rounds up 2014's standout luxury architectural projects",45.5789473684,0.5789473684,1.4210526316,high,low,abstractive,architecture

The latest such partnership to be announced is between the Armani/Casa Interior Design Studio with South Florida developers Dezer Development and the construction company Related Group for the interior design of a residential tower in Miami designed by leading architect César Pelli. The Argentine-American architect is best known for his Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, and also created the Adrienne Arsht Center in Miami.

The 60-storey oceanfront tower is in Sunny Isles Beach (not far from the Porsche Design Tower which has also been developed by Dezer), just north of Bal Harbour, and will house 260 luxury residences. They are expected to be from 2,000 square feet to 3,500 square feet and will be priced from $1.2 million to $5.5 million.

It will be the first North American project for Armani/Casa, which already has several branded residential properties, including the World Towers in Mumbai, India and the Maçka Residences in Istanbul, Turkey. President and chief executive office of the group Giorgio Armani said of the project, ""partnering with a talented architect like César Pelli means we get to create something very special – a remarkable living space, imbued with the spirit of modern elegance"".

""I’ve been living here 43 years,"" she says. ""I was so daunted when I first came, but I was also excited, a sort of 'Wow!', and, for me, that wow has never gone away.""

And, on a misty spring morning, Sudeley Castle is undeniably beautiful, almost floating on its formal gardens, framed by the irregular folds of a Cotswold valley, and outlined by its doughty gatehouse, medieval towers and ruined Plantagenet banqueting hall that stands as testament to a turbulent history of royal owners and Civil War battles. Sudeley’s castellated walls have also witnessed a more recent domestic struggle between public and private – how to keep this 1,000-year-old slice of England as a family home while simultaneously generating sufficient income to keep the leaky roof in good repair by welcoming visitors who pay an entry fee. It is an ongoing dilemma that has defined Lady Ashcombe’s four decades here and, at times, caused friction between her and her two children, Henry and Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst, unflinchingly captured in the 2009 BBC documentary Crisis at the Castle.

Sudeley Castle and Gardens, as it has now been rebranded, has reopened after undergoing the first stage of a three-year, seven-figure refurbishment programme over the winter. More of the private family rooms than ever before will be open to the public seven days a week. Its treasures – Van Dycks and Turners, Anne Boleyn’s lace canopy, Marie Antoinette’s bed hangings, Charles I’s bed, and Katherine Parr’s books and very superior red velvet privy – have been given fresh prominence in reconfigured rooms, all painstakingly redecorated under Lady Ashcombe’s eye.

What prompted all this activity was a decline over recent years in Sudeley’s visitor numbers, which threatened to make the place unsustainable. ""Those we asked were complaining they were not seeing the castle,"" she explains. ""In fact, they were seeing all the medieval parts, which are the real castle, but we have now arranged it so that they can see a lot of the rooms where we live as well.""

If she is sounding slightly ungracious, then something is lost in translation. It is more a weariness at the scale of her task. This is her third relaunch. A doctor’s daughter from Kentucky, she first visited Sudeley in 1962, soon after meeting and marrying Mark Dent-Brocklehurst, who had inherited the castle as a teenager on the death of his father. His widowed mother, Mary, remained in residence, while he worked in London as a stockbroker. When she eventually moved out in the late 1960s, her son and his American wife opted to position Sudeley in the vanguard of a brand new movement, the ""stately home business"". They visited other pioneers – the Duke of Bedford’s Woburn Abbey, the Marquis of Bath’s Longleat – and adapted the lessons they had learnt. ""But this isn’t a stately home in that sense,"" Lady Ashcombe says. ""We are not big enough. I always describe us as a historic house of heritage.""

In 1972 she had to face carrying the burden of Sudeley alone. Her husband died of a heart attack at the age of 40, leaving her a widow with their two small children to bring up and crippling death duties to pay. He hadn’t even got round to making a will. As a result, rather than passing to his son, as is the way in upper-class families, the estate was split between his wife and children, Lady Ashcombe’s half share being a life interest that will eventually be divided between her son and daughter. ""Mark’s death struck a deep wound,"" she says, ""but he was so devoted to Sudeley. I decided it would have been unfair of me not to try to keep it for Henry and Mollie [then aged eight and six], until they were old enough to make a decision for themselves.""

By selling land and some paintings she managed to make ends meet, but by the 1980s she faced a new challenge. How was she going to refashion the family part of the house to create separate quarters for her growing children, and for her second husband, Lord ""Harry"" Ashcombe, an old friend of Mark Dent-Brocklehurst, and the uncle of the Duchess of Cornwall. This prompted the second reordering and relaunch.

But last year she was widowed again, and found herself facing a potentially fatal combination of rising maintenance costs and falling visitor numbers. Deciding there were limits to her expertise, despite 40 years in the stately home business, she summoned in outside help in the form of two former City executives, Toby Roberts and Martin McWilliam, who were persuaded out of retirement to job-share as chief executive of Sudeley Castle and Gardens.

""This was my mother-in-law’s favourite room."" Lady Ashcombe is giving me a preview of the new route she has mapped through the revamped public and private sections. We are in the Morning Room, in the East Wing. The main section of Sudeley today is a U-shaped run of rooms around a central courtyard, all with thick walls and leaded windows. Originally they would have been servants’ quarters. Beyond the courtyard lies the old heart of the castle, Richard III’s once splendid Banqueting Hall, a shadow of itself after Sudeley was punished by Roundheads for taking the Royalist side in the Civil War.

""My mother-in-law always used to say she couldn’t understand me because of my American accent,"" Lady Ashcombe says, suddenly in reflective mood as she points out a portrait of Mary Dent-Brockle­hurst hanging in the window bay. ""We’d always expected her to go on living here for many more years. Then one day Mark was asked to meet her, here in the Morning Room. It was where things were talked about, if they had to be, and she dropped a bomb. She had found a house nearby and was moving out. 'It is time you and Liz took over.'""

The family seat had seen better days. ""I had grown up in America. I was used to a more modern way of living. What I remember most was just how cold it was. It was a fusty old building that hadn’t been touched since the 1930s.""

In her mother-in-law’s heyday the tension between family home and public space simply didn’t exist. As a concession she would let in hoi polloi on a few select days in the summer. ""The old governess and the old butler would show visitors round. If we were staying at the time, we would be told to disappear after luncheon. And then the gardener’s wife would serve tea to the visitors and see them off the premises."" Hardly the foundations for a commercial operation, but in 1969 the new custodians felt they had no option. Out went the linoleum flooring, the blackout curtains and air of post-war austerity, plus many of the Downton Abbey-style downstairs staff. In their place came guides and public lavatories, car parks and display cabinets, fire escapes and guidebooks.

Lady Ashcombe is keen to be getting on with the tour. She is in her early 70s, but has the vim and vigour of a young woman as she sets a cracking pace along corridors and up and down staircases to show off the fruits of her latest labours. As we head for the library, another part of the castle to be opened up, the approach corridor is hung with 18th-century prints by George Vertue, delicate copies of Holbein’s portraits of 33 members of the Tudor court. This collection is one of the 20 treasures that form the staging posts of the new tour. Most had been on display previously, but the new team at Sudeley felt they hadn’t stood out sufficiently amid the accumulated mementoes of six centuries. And in the vast, airy library is another, a 16th-century Sheldon tapestry, of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from paradise. It was one of the works acquired for Sudeley in the 19th century by the Dent family, wealthy Victorian glove-makers and amateur antiquarians, who were inspired to rescue what had become a near ruin (its shell was being used as a pub).

""When we first arrived, there were boxes and boxes of things that Emma Dent had collected, all stored away by my mother-in-law in a room,"" Lady Ashcombe says. ""When I started opening them…"" She sucks in her breath, as if reliving the moment she discovered their contents. It is a simple gesture that links her to the long line of indefatigable, independent women who have taken charge of this castle, and shaped its past and present to their own personality. They stretch all the way back to Princess Goda, the daughter of the Anglo-Saxon king Ethelred the Unready, given Sudeley as a wedding present by her father in the late 10th century, onwards through Katherine Parr, Emma Dent and the austere Mary Dent-Brocklehurst.

And what about its tag as England’s most romantic castle? ""Well, there is a romance to its surroundings, to its intimacy, and to the adventure of it, but I don’t see it as falling-in-love romantic. For me it has always been the romance of its history.""

Which is what, in the end, has kept her hard at it all these years, hosting soirees to raise funds, enlisting the support of old friends such as the historian David Starkey to draw in more visitors, and hiring it out at £20,000 a go as a to-die-for wedding venue. It was at Sudeley, in 2007, that her son Henry’s great friend Elizabeth Hurley married the Indian textile heir Arun Nayar.

Through it all, though, the question of finally one day being forced to sell Sudeley has hovered somewhere in the background. It was, she admits, one option that she raised with her first husband in the late 1960s, when his mother decided to decamp. Life would have turned out very different for her if he had been prepared to countenance it. And it bubbled up again when she remarried and her children had grown up. There was even interest expressed at that time in turning it into a golf club.

If the uncertainty has been dispersed by committing to the latest relaunch, it has not been entirely dispelled. With her new management team she is more optimistic about the business than she has been for years, but the future, she insists, is ultimately for her children to decide. Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst, who runs a London gallery, certainly seems to have inherited a love of the place. She spends a good deal of time here with her two children, and in the summer months arranges for striking works of sculpture to be displayed in the castle’s gardens. Her older brother, Henry, meanwhile, seems a little cooler. He now lives in Hawaii with his model wife, Lili Maltese, and their three sons, but returns regularly.

So Lady Ashcombe will continue as chatelaine for the time being. Despite the stresses and strains, she clearly enjoys it. ""What is most important for me about keeping Sudeley going is that its history is so integral, so much part of the English story, part of the people we are [she became a naturalised Brit 10 years ago]. It would be a drop in the ocean if we gave up, but no one else would come along to do it if we don’t carry on. And if others in grander houses did the same, then a huge part of England’s history would be lost.""","The plan to entice punters to the Cotswold castle is a three-year, seven-figure refurbishment programme that gives up more secrets than ever before",83.5714285714,0.8214285714,4.3928571429,high,medium,mixed,architecture

The market is “on fire”, as Howard Elston, director of Aylesford International, puts it. Foreign buyers will continue to dominate the picture and new areas are becoming magnets for international wealth – Battersea’s vast Nine Elms regeneration area, for example, Marylebone, whose new boutique developments are breaking previous price ceilings and Mayfair, no longer Belgravia’s poor cousin.

But prime London’s market sizzles beneath an ominous shadow: the threatened Mansion Tax. Until the May 2015 election, no one can know exactly what the tax – Labour’s proposed one per cent annual levy on homes worth £2m or more – will mean for property values. But Trevor Abrahmsohn, director of Glentree Estates, who sells some of London’s most expensive mansions in Hampstead’s The Bishop’s Avenue, sees it in dramatic terms. “It will drive a coach and horses through the finely balanced dynamics of the residential property market, the like of which has not been seen since the Second World War.”

""Many owners of high value homes aren’t prepared to wait and take the risk, so they’re downsizing in anticipation. That's a trend that's likely to continue next year, with more renters likely to target the top end of the London property market as a result, says Camilla Dell, partner at Black Brick buying agency. “But non-doms will continue to flood in, despite a new capital gains tax on profits from April 2015,” she adds of the new announcement that overseas investors in UK property will have to pay tax on any profits.

Among those non-doms, Chinese buyers will come to the fore in London next year, says Rachel Thompson, a partner in The Buying Solution, branching out from the new-build riverfront developments that have typically attracted them to more traditional period properties, while Middle Eastern buyers will increasingly diversify to the commercial sector.

For those with aspirations of digging deep in Kensington & Chelsea or Westminster, 2014 will be the year to do it before their local councils – who are already clamping down on mega-basement conversions – put a stop to the practice entirely.

As for areas on the up, the South Bank is “the most exciting contemporary urban quarter” and firmly on the prime central London map now, according to Savills, who predict 25 per cent growth over the next five years. New projects include South Bank Tower, an overhaul of the 1970s King’s Reach Tower, where 173 flats will launch in Spring from £650,000 through Savills and CBRE.

The South Bank’s competition will come from The Strand, soon to be rebranded ""North Bank"" and to become a “world class destination”, according to Ben Babington from Jackson-Stops & Staff, who are marketing the new 353 The Strand development, with apartments costing from £2.35m. Neighbouring Covent Garden and the “city fringe” are also part of the WC2 overhaul and will see buyers migrate from the likes of Mayfair.

Overseas, residency will be the buzzword in 2014. Following in Portugal’s footsteps, Spain recently launched its ""golden visa"" scheme, offering residency to non-EU nationals in return for at least €500,000 in Spanish property. Malta has introduced a new Global Residence Programme for non-EU nationals and similar incentives are taking off in the Caribbean, where the success of St Kitts’ citizenship programme has driven Antigua and Grenada to launch similar schemes. Barbados is also making it easier for buyers to invest by relaxing the amount of time they can stay without needing to renew their visas.

Spain will be hoping for some light at the end of the tunnel, now that it’s officially out of recession. Bill Gates has shown a vote of confidence by investing in the Spanish construction industry FCC and Ibiza’s property market is set to continue to fly next year, with British buyers back in force. “But don’t expect any bargains,” says Alex Vaughan from Lucas Fox. “For that, head to Barcelona, the Costa Brava or Marbella, whose markets have seen big price drops but are now recovering.”

Italy – whose luxury property market saw prices fall by up to 20 per cent this year, according to Linda Travella from Casa Travella estate agency – is hoping to tempt investors by reducing buying costs from January (you’ll save around €12,000 on a €1m home) and Tuscany will be the place for Italian bargains, says Paul Belcher from Ultissimo. “The large supply of luxury properties, some at distressed prices, will put the brakes on price rises for at least another year,” he says.

So, mixed fortunes await in London and incentives galore are on offer in weaker markets abroad.

Gone is the ""chap in a cap"" of old who held the keys and knew all the gossip. These days, the best London concierges are a high-powered breed who will ensure a Rolls-Royce is waiting at your disposal, or sort out your family holiday to Mustique. “We’ve seen a number of ex-military concierges who look the part – an ear-piece is very much de rigueur. They are extremely well-connected and give the residents an impression of feeling extremely well looked after,” says Jo Eccles from Sourcing Property.

One new example is Rhodium, who are part owned by the Monaco royal family and work with developers including Finchatton and Candy & Candy. Their tasks have included organising a private Boeing 747 to take one family to Fiji, flying over 18 tropical fish from the Maldives and arranging for the Gipsy Kings to perform in a private apartment.

Requests can be of a less ostentatious nature too. At NEO Bankside on London’s South Bank, where flats start at £3.35m, concierge staff have been asked to play cricket outside on Christmas day and rush to the airport with a forgotten passport.

Ed Tryon from buying agents Lichfields says the bar has been set by Candy & Candy, whose One Hyde Park development has the Mandarin Oriental’s concierge team to pamper residents, including providing fully-stocked fridges and ensuring that your preferred daily paper is waiting in the car each morning. “The Knightsbridge apartments, which cost £4m-£20m and, on higher floors, overlook Hyde Park, also really stand out. Many of the staff have been there since the building opened and are hugely protective of the residents and will always go the extra mile. They take a very firm approach when it comes to visitors, too,” says Tryon.

In new upmarket developments in the likes of Knightsbridge or St John’s Wood, the role of today’s concierge is “far more about communication and service levels now, where complex itineraries need to be sorted – to which women are better suited - rather than the basic meet and meet service typically done by men in the more traditional buildings”, says Nicholas Ayre from Home Fusion buying agency.

For owners renting out their properties, a high-end concierge service will add a 10 per cent rental premium, says Marc Von Grundherr from Benham & Reeves lettings agency – but you’ll pay for the privilege. Service charges of £9 per square foot are not unusual, according to Marcus Bardbury-Ross from Prime Purchase, with owners of 9,000 sq ft flats at One Hyde Park paying up to £126,000 a year.

The concierge’s natural habitat – the lobby – has also had a drastic image change, with double-height oases dotted with original contemporary sculptures and eclectic furniture now favoured (the front desk at Fitzrovia Apartments in Marylebone, where a three-bed flat is on sale through Druce for £3.25m, is carved from one huge piece of granite).

In Virginia Water – an extension of prime central London in terms of the wealth and type of international buyer it attracts – Barton Wyatt estate agents launch their concierge service, not for residents in a block of flats but those who inhabit the huge mansions on the Wentworth Estate. As director James Wyatt lives nearby, he personally attends to many of the requests, from kick-starting kitchen appliances to interviewing house staff and arranging planning applications.

It’s all a case of “nothing is too much trouble” for today’s wealthy buyers. As Sourcing Property’s Jo Eccles says of the new concierge culture, “think Four Seasons – but on tap in your own home”.",Nothing is too much trouble for the new breed of high-powered property concierges,52.2666666667,1.0,2.8666666667,high,high,mixed,architecture

Okay, so it wasn't just any timber – noce canaletto americano wood to be exact – and it wasn't just any doll's house either, more of a puzzle really, designed to encourage interactive play by Zaha Hadid Architects.

It was one of 20 contemporary houses, each designed by a top British-based architecture practice for the A Doll's House auction, with the house that Zaha built achieved the highest bid. However, Lifschutz Davidson Sandlilands doll's house wasn't far behind, after some fierce bidding their colourful, towering 1.5m high creation composed of three-sided rooms went for £11,000 – to a buyer who lives in a house designed by the same practice.

Meanwhile, Fat Architecture's Tower of Fable, a brutalist toy-sized remake of Erno Goldfinger's Balfron Tower featuring 10 small ceramic pieces by the artist Grayson Perry, attracted a top bid of £10,000. It was bought by Richard Upton, chief executive of the Cathedral Group, the property developers behind the event.

Most of the auction at Bonhams new HQ at 101 New Bond Street (also, it happens, designed by Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands), happened silently, with staff stationed at each doll's house taking bids on tablets, but the most popular six went to a live auction, playfully conducted by auctioneer Matthew Girling.

The Doll's House concept was conceived by Martyn Evans, creative director of the Cathedral Group, which has been responsible for innovative urban developments such as The Deptford Project train carriage café amongst many other projects. Evans was inspired by the mini-mansion created by Edwin Lutyens for Queen Mary in 1922, which showcased the best of contemporary interior design of the time.

""The sale last night went better than we could ever have expected, it was extraordinary,"" said Evans. ""FAT's Balfron Tower which has the Grayson Perry artworks in it was one of our favourites right from the start and we were determined to have it in our office. We love that building.""

All 44 properties – priced from £3m – come with an original framed photograph of Marylebone by David Bailey, each worth around £20,000.

“The Chilterns is setting a benchmark in high-end development projects and setting a trend for utilising original art,” says the project’s interior designer, Rabih Hage. “Others will follow in its footsteps.”

Well, he’s right; the world of luxury property and original art are becoming inextricably entwined. St James Group’s new Riverlight development in Battersea, South London – designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners – won’t just have the usual retail and leisure facilities alongside its 802 flats for sale. Having partnered up with the Royal College of Art, it has designated three quarters of the land as open artspace, to include public shows, talks and screenings.

Londonnewcastle, whose COO Robert Soning is an avid art collector, hand picks original contemporary and street art for each of their developments, including the forthcoming Rosebery Avenue in Clerkenwell, where they are collaborating with New York artist Marco Branbilla. “Our clients are used to seeing art in public and entertainment spaces in London. It seems natural that art should extend out of these spaces and into the shared spaces in developments such as reception areas, lifts, club and private dining rooms,” says Soning.

Lethbridge House on Cornwall Terrace, overlooking Regent’s Park, is on sale for £40m through Beauchamp Estates, with its art collection (which includes works by Mark Quinn) available for an additional £800,000. In Knightsbridge, Savills are selling a house on Brompton Square for £27.5m that includes a row of original Damien Hirst butterflies in the kitchen.

On occasion, the art is worth more than the mansion. In Hampstead, Glentree Estates have sold houses whose £50m price tags pale in relation to the value of their paintings. One American couple in St John’s Wood had a house “literally draped in Lucian Freuds, Bacons, Chagalls and Giacomettis, worth a multiple of the value of the house,” says Saul Empson from Haringtons UK. They moved to Notting Hill to a house that was a better showcase for the art.

Besides adding colour and identity to a luxury property that has otherwise been decked out with exquisite neutrality, prestigious art collections serve as a filter for prospective buyers. “Developers are moving away from designing homes to appeal to the majority and catering to a specific demographic through their interior design and art,” says Mark Hutton, associate director at Douglas & Gordon.

High art demands space to be seen, which is leading to the creation of personal galleries in many high-end London homes that could be straight out of the Tate, with perfect lighting, humidity levels and security. David Adams from John Taylor estate agency mentions one in-house gallery that is shielded by steel doors and a permanent guard.

“I often think that top end developers are missing a trick by not including gallery space within the home,” says central London buying agent Robert Bailey, who cites one owner in central London who bought the house next door to his home, just to accommodate his art collection. “Anyone buying at this level invariably has an art collection they will be keen to display.”

Art is not for every palate, of course. A huge Lucian Freud canvas of the late performance artist Leigh Bowery, naked astride a toilet, hindered rather than helped sell one Hampstead home, says Saul Empson. “It serially distracted buyers as it wasn’t the first thing they wanted to see in the morning.”",Fancy investing in some contemporary art?

It is shown in the picture by Canaletto that Lord Lloyd-Webber paid £9.2 million for in 1992. (It’s on show at the Tate until next Sunday. Note the tiny figure of a man peeing against the outside wall of David Cameron’s rose garden, a need better catered for today by the efficient Olympic organisers.)

More restrained than Horse Guards’ “restless” skyline (as Pevsner calls it) is the serene Queen’s House, Greenwich, chosen as the scene for dressage and suchlike horsey arts. Built by the man whom Kent worshipped, Inigo Jones, it was finished in 1635, decades before Greenwich Hospital, which Wren had the sensible genius to centre on the small white building, framed, in the view from the river, by receding colonnades.

The river has come into its own in the Games, as it did at the Jubilee. London usually turns its back on the Thames. It is invisible from the Strand or from our one grand processional way, the Mall (which deserves an Olympic gold of its own). But crowds at the equestrian cross-country events at Greenwich looked down from the hill of the Observatory and meridian, over the wide Thames to that remarkable view of London with the blighted bankers’ Canary Wharf in the foreground, masking the Olympic Park in the faraway Lea Valley.

The Thames, sweet Thames once more, now the fish have returned, runs softly from the lake at Eton Dorney, under 37 bridges, past Hampton Court’s chimneyed film-set (where Wiggins triumphed) and curves past the Embankment. Here the marathon runners will on Sunday pass the modest memorial to Joseph Bazalgette, who built it, with useful sewers beneath. “Flumini vincula posuit,” it says in funny writing: “He put the river in chains.”

We saw during the women’s marathon what a good idea it was to put the route through the dear, dead Sunday streets of the City. The runners strode through the curiously attractive arcade of Leadenhall Market (glimpsed in a Harry Potter film), which many people never get round to seeing. It’s on the site of the Roman forum. Indeed, the marathon route is a serious history lesson, taking in the Monument (from which the libel blaming the Papists for the Great Fire was removed a mere 182 years before the Games) and reaching its halfway point below Bow Bells in Cheapside, where Becket’s father bought a house 900 years ago, next to Ironmonger Lane, as it was called then and still is.

The crowds and television viewers won’t be able to see what isn’t there – the tragedy of London’s fine buildings bombed by enemies, lost in fires, worse, torn down by 19th-century money-grubbers and stupid modern planners in league with architects. Of Wren’s 51 City churches, seven were lost in the Blitz, but 14 had been demolished by the Victorians for economic reasons.

I had thought that the Olympics would sink the beauties of London in a tawdry maze of crowd-control meshing and vending points. I was wrong. The buildings stand out poignantly in the watery sunshine.

But it is usually the first thing locals remark on when they stop by, says Kenyasue Smart, who has been managing the space since May.

Smart came to The Platform through Meanwhile Space, a social enterprise that finds temporary uses for disused spaces. The Platform is leased from Lambeth council for free and enables people to test retail ideas. “It’s what you make of it,” says Smart, whose background is in research and management. “We’re trying to develop that aspect of community involvement so the people here can have a voice in what is going to happen in the future,” she says.

Meanwhile Space works as an interim landlord, helping people who might be excluded from renting commercial property get their business idea off the ground. “What I hope we offer people is the chance to fail,” says Eddie Bridgeman, director and co-founder of the organisation. “If it doesn’t work out then they haven’t committed themselves to a long lease and something that’s going to financially cripple them for the next five to 10 years.”

Bridgeman and director Emily Berwin co-founded Meanwhile Space in 2009. Back then, as the recession bit, the former communities secretary Hazel Blears promoted short term use of vacant retail spaces to help revive town centres.

With funding, Meanwhile Project (as it was known then) offered practical and financial support for a range of temporary uses of space across the country. When the fuding ended three years ago, it became a community interest company, making money by charging tenants rent at cheap rates.

In recent years, commercial property rents have rocketed, making it hard to find affordable space in London. Rent increased 70% between 2010 and 2015 to an average of £55 per square foot, according to recent research by EY.

Bridgeman says at first they were concerned that Meanwhile Space would just be a recession business. “But if anything when property is booming landlords are more willing to sit on stuff so the vacant opportunities come along a bit more regularly,” he says.

Once a location is scouted – usually after a bit of door knocking and calls to the Land Registry – Meanwhile Space negotiates a flexible lease and does minimal renovations before renting it out for the lowest cost possible. An archway in Loughborough Junction, for example, is about £350 a month.

The organisation tends to find clusters of properties in deprived town centres. It has occupied over 40 across the country and has about 25 spaces in use at the moment, including premises in Wembley, Walthamstow and Hastings, for a range of businesses such as food, florists, party supplies and kids clothing. From its inception to 2015, it claims to have supported 511 people and created 170 jobs. “If you’ve got a proposal and need the space then we will try and find you the space,” says Bridgeman.

The tenants – about 80% of whom are underemployed or unemployed according to Meanwhile Space – are found through word of mouth, ties to local recruitment agencies and community events, such as the recent drumming workshop hosted at The Platform. People submit a loose business plan to get a space, with each application judged on its viability to generate income.

In the archway next to Meanwhile Space’s offices is the workspace of Jamie Hoyle, a furniture designer and maker. His business, Koda Studio, would have been a “non-starter” if he had not found the affordable space via Meanwhile Space, he says. “When space comes at such a premium in London, it’s a shame when you walk around spaces and they are just derelict or boarded up and unusable,” he says.

While short-term leases can help people get businesses off the ground, it also means a level of insecurity. Hoyle says he would like to start teaching furniture making in the space, but with a 12-month lease and uncertainty over Network Rail’s plans for the archways, he does not want to risk expanding, only to have to move.

In neighbouring Brixton, redevelopment proposals for the railway arches have sparked controversy, with concerns that the existing independent traders will be pushed out by rent increases.

Across London gentrification has been driving up prices and displacing communities. In reviving vacant spaces by filling them with entrepreneurs and creatives, does Meanwhile Space risk accelerating these economic forces? Bridgeman says not. “We provide little havens of affordability in areas where prices are going up – gentrification is a wider force than anything that we do,” he says. “What we try and do is get what we can out of gentrification for local people.”

Getting the right balance of locals with ties to the community and tenants from outside who can provide stimulation, is key to the success of such place-making schemes, says Graeme Evans, professor in design cultures at the University of Middlesex. “The claims that creative industries’ growth directly benefits local economies will only be true over time if local residents, businesses and those not normally entering or getting access to this sector, are able to access this provision,” he says.

But by the nature of temporary workspace, there are no guarantees on how sustainable such as scheme will be for the community in the long term. “Short licences are great for startups and for project based work, but most want to stay for longer so what happens then?” says Evans. “You need some kind of hierarchy of space and lease terms to prevent blocking up of space but also to sustain artists and SMEs as they grow, but where they can’t afford full commercial rents.”

Having recently bought and renovated a five-storey building in Hastings, Bridgeman sees Meanwhile Space’s future in buying and turning more property into affordable live and work spaces. “If you can own stuff, you can control the rent and if you have a long-term vision on that, you don’t need to necessarily scrape all the profit from it,” he says.",Gentrification is driving up prices in London.

It is a star approximately 1500 light years away from the Earth, and displays a strange pattern of dimming that has astronomers scratching their heads.

With many natural causes apparently ruled out, there is even the suggestion that the signals could be caused by a giant structure, built in space near the star, presumably by extraterrestrials.

Related: Welcome to Earth: a travel guide for aliens | Dean Burnett

The unexplained signals have been found in data collected by Nasa’s Kepler Space Telescope. The mission was launched in 2009 and was designed to find planets by looking for the small dip in light caused when a planet passes in front of the star and blocks a small portion of the light.

It has been remarkably successful adding thousands of planets to the known roster. But in all the 150,000 stars that Kepler has monitored, none have ever looked like KIC 8462852. It stands out because the star dims so dramatically.

Whereas a planet will drop the light by a percent or two at most, this star dims by up to 20 percent. Also unlike a planet, which orbits the star and causes the drop to repeat, these dimmings took place at random intervals during the 1600 days that Kepler was monitoring the star.

Around the 800-day mark, the star’s light dropped by 15 percent, Then around the 1500-day mark, there was a flurry of dimming with one dropping 20 percent of the starlight. To fall that much, the object passing in front of the star must be almost half the diameter of the star. Yet Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is only one-tenth the diameter of the Sun.

To rub salt into the wound, KIC 8462852, is estimated to be about 1.5 times larger than the sun, making the necessary object vast indeed. So it cannot be a planet.

Tabetha Boyajian, Yale University, led the investigations into the mysterious signals and found that the most likely natural cause was the break-up of a comet around the star. As the icy remains expand into giant clouds they could temporarily block out the light, causing the observed signal. But this should cause dust to scatter around the star, producing an excess of infra-red radiation that should be easily detected from Earth. As yet, no such signal has been found.

According to the The Atlantic, Boyajian said that there were “other scenarios” that she was considering. And these are where the aliens come in.

Jason Wright, an astronomer from Penn State University, has been investigating what a huge alien construction in space might look like from Earth. He told The Atlantic: “Aliens should always be the very last hypothesis you consider, but this looked like something you would expect an alien civilization to build.”

It would have to be a huge space station indeed to block out that amount of light, hence the epithet “alien megastructure” that is currently setting Google alight.

This is not the first time that astronomers have speculated about aliens when confronted with an unexplained phenomenon. Famously, the discovery of rotating stellar corpses, eventually called as pulsars, were first suggested to be aliens. The researchers even cheekily labelled the reading ‘LGM-1’ for “little green men”.

When hugely powerful gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) continued to defy explanation decades after their discovery, some suggested they could be the optical equivalent of a sonic boom, taking place because alien starships were accelerating to warp speed. The GRBs were eventually discovered to be exploding stars.

A natural explanation is almost certainly the case here too.

Many of the same objections to natural causes apply to the alien megastructure hypothesis too. Namely, the structure should be in orbit around the star and so should lead to periodic dips in the light.

Also, if something is absorbing 20 percent of a star’s light, it is going to get hot and that means it is going to re-radiate that energy at infrared wavelengths but, as mentioned, no IR-excess has been detected.

The only way to clear up this mystery is to make more observations. Boyajian suggests long-term monitoring from ground-based telescopes to look for a recurrence of the dimming events, and is working with Wright to use a radio telescope to listen in for alien broadcasts leaking from the system.

My money is on comet collisions. But part of me hopes I’m wrong.

Beijing is Africa’s biggest trade partner and has frequently been accused of an ethically deaf “resource colonialism” – extracting the continent’s mineral wealth at knockdown prices to propel its economic growth.

But foreign minister Wang Yi, on a five-nation tour of Africa, insisted: “Politically, we always speak up for African countries and uphold justice. Economically, we help African countries to enhance development to achieve prosperity.

“In China’s exchanges and cooperation with Africa, we want to see mutual benefit and win-win results. I want to make clear one point, that is, China will never follow the track of western colonists and all cooperation with Africa will never come at the expense of the ecology, environment or long-term interests of Africa.”

The comments were made to Chinese Central Television while Wang was in Kenya, where he met President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday. Chinese firms are carrying out a $653m (£430m) expansion of the main airport in the capital, Nairobi.

China’s rivalry with the west on the African stage has been much debated, but it is rare for one side to draw comparison so publicly. Last year, at the biggest gathering of African leaders ever held in Washington, US president Barack Obama said pointedly, “We don’t look to Africa simply for its natural resources,” but declined to mention China by name.

Only in a diplomatic cable, published via WikiLeaks in 2010 and not intended for public consumption, did a US official admit: “China is a very aggressive and pernicious economic competitor with no morals. China is not in Africa for altruistic reasons. China is in Africa for China primarily.”

Previously, Beijing has said its cooperation with African nations ranges across agriculture, health and infrastructure-related projects from schools to stadiums. The $200m headquarters of the Africa Union in Addis Ababa was a present and a “symbol of deepening relations”.

China maintains that more than half its foreign aid – more than $14bn between 2010 and 2012 – goes to Africa. It says the support comes with no strings attached and that it will never interfere in countries’ domestic affairs. But by default, critics argue, this means it effectively shores up the rule of Angola’s José Eduardo dos Santos, Sudan’s Omar al-Bashir and Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, three of Africa’s most tenaciously authoritarian rulers.

Last month, however, Beijing announced that it will send 700 combat troops to join the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, signalling an unusually robust intervention. Speaking to reporters in Sudan on Sunday, Wang defended China’s mediation efforts in South Sudan, rejecting the claim that it was acting out of self-interest after investing heavily in oil.

“China’s mediation of South Sudan issues is completely the responsibility and duty of a responsible power, and not because of China’s own interests,” the minister said.

Wang’s itinerary spans Kenya, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",Foreign minister Wang Yi says Beijing won’t copy ‘western colonialists’ amid claims it exploits African resources for its own economic growth,26.8695652174,0.6956521739,1.3913043478,medium,low,abstractive,architecture

I’ve recently retrained as a building surveyor specialising in building pathology — how buildings decay and require maintenance cycles. My work has a heritage twist that is rooted in my passion for the city’s architecture. Glasgow has an endless range of construction styles and the finest Victorian architecture in the UK. The tenements and impressive civic and business buildings used the local slate and stone to build the city in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Recording these buildings, and attempting to grasp the reasons behind their increasingly vacant, derelict and ruinous existence, is at the heart of my website.

I live in a draughty c.1900 tenement in the city’s southside with my partner and a designer feline. Photographing the city fills my spare time while punk music fills my ears. In a city passionate and divided by football, I am perhaps the sole male who is immune to the lure of men chasing around after a ball.

Glasgow, an economic powerhouse, is a fascinating city full of bluster, confidence and blagging. From the pompous shiny-faced politicians in the George Square “palace” of marble, to the occasional obscene example of contemporary wealth, through to the sectarian undercurrents of religious and football divides, it is a city in constant flux. Beauty is often juxtaposed by ugliness.

The people are approachable, friendly, humorous, clever and passionate. At times they may hate Glasgow or love it – opinions are never hard to find here. The city has a history of partially failed reinvention stretching back decades to its industrial glories. Perhaps more than any other it has tried to regenerate itself in the face of unparalleled social deprivation.

Everything is to be found here: vibrant arts and music, culture, leisure and history, stunning museums and architecture, exceptional seats of learning, wonderful multicultural neighbourhoods, third-sector community projects – all juxtaposed with the dark side: violence, corruption, poverty, unemployment, slum housing, homelessness as well as drugs and alcohol in alarming abundance. It is a city full of hope and yet underpinned by the dark Scottish fatalism, humour and insight.

Lion Chambers (1904-07), is a centrally located A-listed blend of miniature skyscraper and Scottish castle. It combines a small footprint (10 by 14 metres) with use of what was then cutting-edge technology, to rise more than eight storeys. Exhibiting a host of traditional tower-house stylings in tandem with its experimental structural system, it soars above its neighbours.

At the time of its construction, squat powerfully proportioned tenements still rose around the city, using brick and stone-mass walling tied together with timber floors. The revolutionary reinforced-concrete techniques employed at Lion Chambers displayed a modernity of experimental technique in stunning contrast to that of the tenements.

Today the building lies vacant and in a very poor condition. Alexander Thomson’s Egyptian Halls, to the south, is another of Glasgow’s most prominent and centrally located A-listed architectural icons locked in a complex drawn-out spiral of decay. Some strive to save it, others to demolish it, and yet the impetus, willpower and solutions to offer a better future for the building remain just out of reach.

Bluevale tower, one of the twin towers at Bluevale/Whitevale in the East End of Glasgow is perhaps the finest example of the city’s deeply divisive brutalist architectural period and has parallels to Lion Chambers in structural efficiency. A ruthlessly pared-down square design, it soars higher than any other. The audacity of its design can be breathtaking in its conviction and the imposition of form over function. There is a certain bold beauty to this power, defiance and strength, and yet it is terrifyingly bleak and unremittingly awful in other ways.

No European city embraced social housing towers as Glasgow did after the second world war. Today the skyline is changing as these towers are declared unfit for habitation and regular demolitions take place. Perversely this mode of housing is still regarded as suitable for asylum seekers or in the private sector where they are labelled “luxury apartments”.

Suffering poor construction and isolationist design, and following a riot of bad management over decades, the Bluevale/Whitevale towers are now awaiting demolition. The destruction of many of the city’s brutalist towers often seems ideologically driven. While some are undeniably horrendous, others could be given new lives, more effectively than at present, given the huge waiting lists for housing.

Glasgow smokes, Glasgow chews gum, Glasgow eats takeaways. Glaswegians are divided in their use of litter bins or their ability to – without remorse – continue the constant rain of discarded spent consumerism. This is compounded by the unbelievable quantity of discarded mattresses and sofas that are dumped on the streets on a weekly basis. Battling this, the city’s cleansers prowl with mighty dustcarts endlessly carrying out their thankless task of chomping them down and removing them to unsustainable landfill.

On the tarmac of the UK’s most polluted city, the mass of buses and traffic curse us with the silent killer of pollution particles with levels far in excess of those considered healthy. In some pollution hotspots, the deep breathing of the speedy cyclists draws so much pollution into their lungs that you wonder whether it’s the equivalent of lycra-clad chain-smoking. Glasgow has a long way to go to clean up its act, recycle, re-use and learn from many of its European neighbours.

Some years ago Glasgow was slashed with the planning equivalent of a “Glasgow kiss”, or headbutt, in the form of the vertical smile of the M8 urban motorway – carved across the city after the war. Like all urban motorways, a heavy price was paid with the destruction of architecture, communities and the city’s Chicago-esque grid. To this day the convenience proffered faces off the pollution suffered. The endless traffic lights provoke “amber gambling”, which now seems to have run into “red peril” as many take further risks. Bus lanes are increasingly being monitored, provoking fury as motorists incur fines for minor infractions often caused by poor signage or undertaking those turning right.

Step out the metal machine and the subway provides effective transport for the shorter members of society or those prepared to stoop due to its toy-train proportions. Fortunately this is supplemented by a good railway, largely electrified and the mass of buses. I have always cycled and our numbers are ever increasing and yet the infrastructure fails us and the risks can be great. Cars parked in cycle lanes and nonsensical cycle lanes sometimes just yards long are a regular sight.

Glasgow can be remarkably quiet, peaceful and beautiful. There is still much of the “dear green place”. At any time this can be shattered by sirens: the emergency services love a bit of the New York wail of “get the fuck out the way!’ For many the aural isolation of permanently affixed headphones cuts out both this and the diesel rumble of buses and the unique nasal drawl of the “weegie” accent peppering the streets.

Finally, the summer marching season can mean you are rudely awoken by pipes and drums in a throwback to the past and others’ tribal traditions. Without a Christian background, I have no side to take. I can see why the preservation of freedom of speech and the right to assemble means that dismantling the marches could backfire, though the trouble and expense such marches impose can be deeply demoralising to many.

I would favour conversing while walking through my local park, or perhaps sitting with a pint in a local hostelry. But frankly, for Glaswegians, anywhere will do – my fellow citizens are full of banter regardless of location. Unlike many cities I have visited, here the locals will help and speak to you, they will not pass by like drones.

As I crisscross the city photographing the architecture and more, it seems for many it is the electric soup of Buckfast Tonic Wine. While many cities pedal the urban myth of proximity to a rat, here the green glass bottle of the tonic wine never seems far away. As a photography side project, every time I see one of these I’ll snap it. Hundreds of photos later, this obscure gallery of glass features shattered and intact examples from across all areas of the city. Personally, the one indispensable item is a camera and for all in Glasgow, a wee bit of attitude and humour goes a long way.

There is a degree of tempered optimism. The 2014 games promises much in terms of legacy, but will the Commonwealth Games add to the wealth of the common? Only analysis numerous years hence will show the truth. For now it has undeniably given the city fresh hope, profile and vibrancy.

From an architectural perspective, there is an ever-ageing crumbling building stock (80% of current stock predicted to be in use in 40 years). Underfunded and lacking priority, this is problem being stored up for future generations and will be exacerbated by climate change. Combined with this, there is a shameful social housing crisis with demolitions massively outstripping the delivery of new-builds, which falls way short of those promised.

However it is our city, and hope and optimism should always be encouraged to flourish, no matter how dark are certain corners of Glasgow’s problems. Learning from others and our own history, embracing multiculturalism and seeking change combined with the local indefatigable spirit means Glasgow always stands a chance.","Joe Shaldon of Derelict Glasgow shows us the brutalism, the beauty and the Buckfast of Scotland’s largest city",91.85,0.7000000000000001,0.9,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Israel's attack on the Gaza power plant on Tuesday is likely to fuel speculation that the enclave's civilian infrastructure is being deliberately targeted in the continuing war against Hamas.

The Israeli army has said previously that it does not target critical non-military facilities, insisting that it is seeking to destroy terrorist targets such as tunnels and rockets that are fired into Israel. It did not immediately comment on the power station shelling, reportedly by tanks. It was ""simply not known"" what had happened, one official told the Guardian.

The scale of Gaza's humanitarian crisis has alarmed human rights organisations. Last week, Israeli NGOs warned that more than half of Gaza's 1.8 million people were now affected by a lack of adequate access to water and sanitation services, with raw sewage spilling on to the streets from damaged pipes. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are without power. Hundreds of thousands more face severe shortages.

Between five and eight of the 10 power lines that bring electricity from Israel have been disabled, some by Hamas rocket fire. Maintenance crews have been unable to reach them to carry out repairs. Refrigeration and hospital services that are close to breaking point will also suffer. Civilian suffering looks set to boost international anger over the crisis. ""No power, no water, no hope,"" tweeted the film star Mia Farrow. ""Poor, poor Gaza and it's people.""

If the power station attack was deliberate it may signal the application of the so-called ""Dahiya doctrine"" – the idea that Israel will use its overwhelming technology and firepower to destroy far more than strictly military targets. If it was accidental it will likely raise new questions about Israel's claims to be accurate in its targeting.

The concept is named after the southern suburbs of Beirut, (Dahiya in Arabic) where Hezbollah has its strongholds, hit by intensive Israel bombing in the 2006 war as the militant Lebanese Shia organisation fired rockets into Israel. The idea is to use disproportionate force to damage civilian property and infrastructure in the hope of undermining popular support for the armed group in control of the area. Haaretz's military correspondent Amos Harel was reminded of the Lebanese example as he surveyed the devastation in the Gaza suburb of Shujaiyeh, at the weekend.

In the past, influential Israeli politicians have called for power to Gaza to be shut off. Zeev Elkin, chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee, asked Binyamin Netanyahu, about cutting off water and electricity from Israel into the strip. Netanyahu responded that government legal advisers would not permit that. The issue has also come before Israel's high court. Israel did however target the Gaza power plant in 2006 and in 2009 and hit a Lebanese plant in the 2006 war.

Gaza produces a lot of its own food and staples are allowed in despite the overall blockade. But shortages are growing as residents try to stock up during lulls in the fighting and farms on the eastern edge of the strip have become inaccessible. Stocks have come under pressure with the end of Ramadan and this week's Eid holiday. Banks are closed. Cash is in short supply.

Three weeks of combat have also restricted the number of trucks entering Gaza from Israel. According to Gisha, an NGO that monitors access, an average of 81 truckloads have entered Gaza per day compared to 194 a day in June, – a 58% decrease. Israel has limited the inflow of types of permitted goods to food, medicine and fuel, along with humanitarian supplies.

The World Food Programme says more than 115,000 people in Gaza are in urgent need of food assistance. It has reached more than 100,000 with emergency rations since the crisis started but is running low on stocks of ready-to-eat food.

Looking beyond the immediate crisis, talk has begun about reconstruction. The UN has announced a $115m (£68m) plan to rebuild Gazan homes, schools and hospitals. The cost is certain to continue to rise as long as the fighting rages.","With blackouts, food shortages and sewage in the streets, observers say the IDF either targets civilians or has terrible aim",36.0,0.5909090909,0.6818181818,high,low,abstractive,architecture

Several people have been killed as a powerful suicide car bomb exploded near Somalia's parliament on Saturday, police and witnesses said.

Al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab rebels claimed responsibility for the bombing, the latest in a surge of attacks in the capital, Mogadishu, during Islam's holy month of Ramadan.

""A car loaded with explosives was intercepted near the parliament and it went off. There are casualties but we don't have details so far,"" a police official, Mohamed Idle, told AFP. He confirmed a suicide bomber was in the car.

Police and witnesses at the scene said as many as four were killed and many more wounded. Police spokesman Qasim Ahmed Roble said two policemen were among the dead.

Al-Shabaab, who have carried out frequent attacks against the parliament and other centres of Somalia's fragile, internationally-backed government, said they were responsible and vowed their attacks would continue.

""We killed more than a dozen so-called police members after sacrificial attack at the main entrance of parliament buildings,"" Abdulaziz Abu Musab, military spokesman of al-Shabaab, told AFP.

""We want to tell them that the MPs are not safe anywhere in Mogadishu. By the grace of Allah more attacks will come and continue.""

Last month, militants from teh group set off a car bomb at the gates of parliament and then stormed the building while MPs were meeting, in an attack that left several dead.

At the time a spokesman described the parliament as a ""military zone"" and a legitimate target.

The fire, which barreled through the apartment’s construction site, sent up black smoke that could be seen for miles around the San Francisco Bay, and continued to burn into Wednesday morning as authorities worked determine what sparked the destructive blaze.

The tower that burned in the two-building, partly built complex had previously stood eight or nine stories tall and was reduced to four stories in the fire, Mindy Talmadge, a spokeswoman for the fire department said. “The good thing is that it collapsed in on itself” instead of toward the street, she said.

The exact cause of the fire – one of the city’s largest in recent years – was under investigation, but crews were welding at the site of the blaze, San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said. The five-alarm fire appears to have started above ground, according to Lee. Crews prevented flames from spreading to nearby buildings.

Talmadge added that 30 apartments in a building across the street had to be evacuated, after heat from the fire blew out that structure’s windows and smoke set off its sprinkler system. Authorities have set up a perimeter around the burned high-rise tower because of the risk of further collapse, and the structure is a total loss, she said.

The fast-moving blaze, which sent an enormous plume of black smoke into the sky, began around 5pm, Tuesday, in San Francisco’s Mission Bay neighborhood, a one-time industrial area that lies along the San Francisco Bay and is home to a University of California, San Francisco campus. Crews remained at the scene on Wednesday morning putting out hotspots.

Nearby buildings were evacuated as more than 150 firefighters battled the flames, using about 90 fire trucks, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The Chronicle also reported that the project was estimated to cost $227m. Residents of Strata remained evacuated on Wednesday morning.

The San Francisco fire deputy chief of operations, Mark Gonzales, said exterior sprinklers on the building that went off have to be replaced and the fire protection system restored before residents will be allowed back in.

The fire also affected a nearby UCSF research building, where an ember was quickly put out after flying onto the roof, officials said. “I think we’re very lucky that the fire didn’t jump anymore,” Lee said.

The burning building was part of a residential development project with 172 units, according to BRE Properties, the building’s owner. Fire-suppression systems had not yet been installed in the building, making the battle more difficult, fire officials said.

One of the six-story structure’s walls collapsed about an hour after the fire began, and the rest of the building was not expected to remain standing, officials said.

Most of the construction workers at the site finished work for the day around 4pm, but several were still at the site when firefighters arrived, fire officials said.

One firefighter suffered first and second-degree burns to the face and hands, but was treated and released. Another had a minor ankle injury. The site is several blocks from AT&T Park stadium.","Firefighters contain blaze from spreading beyond construction site where it began, as authorities work to determine its cause",34.1578947368,0.8947368421,1.3157894737,medium,medium,abstractive,architecture

Authorities suspected dozens more may be trapped under the rubble, but were still trying to determine how many workers were on site when the five-storey structure crumpled on Saturday afternoon in Canacona in the state of Goa. Witnesses reported seeing at least 40 labourers.

Soldiers and firefighters listened for movement or cries from the wreckage as they worked overnight to clear the debris, state official Venancio Furtado said.

At least 10 people were pulled out alive overnight, but the chance of finding more survivors was dwindling, Furtado said.

Goa's chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, said he had ordered a review of the construction project after seeing cracks that developed in the adjacent apartment building constructed by the same company, Mumbai-based Bharat Developers and Realtors.

""The design is faulty, which is why the tragedy happened,"" Parrikar said.

Police began investigating both the building company and city officials who approved the construction on a patch of marshland in Canacona, about 44 miles (70 kilometres) from the state capital of Panaji. But they have been unable to track down the construction manager and building contractor.

""Without the contractor, it is impossible for us to know how many labourers were on the shift,"" said state official Ajit Panchwadkar, who was supervising the rescue effort on Sunday.

Many of the workers had come from other, poorer states including Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in search of jobs in India's thriving construction business. One worker who was not at the scene when the building collapsed said he earned about 300 rupees ($4.80) for a day's work, according to Press Trust of India.

Several workers took the day off on Saturday to attend a nearby state cultural fair.

Saddam Hussein had a thing for gold loos and erotic fantasy murals. Blonde beefcakes wrestled with serpents while scantily clad heroines rode on flying carpets across the walls of his gilded banqueting suites. He liked history too, rebuilding Frankenstein versions of ancient Babylonian palaces up and down the country in a steroidal Islamo-brutalist pastiche.

Colonel Gaddafi, meanwhile, preferred the simple life. He opted to live in a luxury Bedouin-style tent in the grounds of his fortified mansion, filled with jewel-encrusted guns and mermaid thrones. He mixed this desert-disco chic with a touch of the teenage girl's bedroom: a wall-size poster of Jake Gyllenhaal was found adorning one of his grand halls.

So what about monster of the moment, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad? We know he's a bit of a tech geek, as former head of the Syrian Computer Society, and is a keen amateur photographer, but it is a mystery what makes this ophthalmologist-turned-butcher feel at home.

The tacky taste of tyrants is usually only revealed once they have been toppled, when the US army moves in and converts the ruins of their glitzy creations into palatial playgrounds for demob-happy troops. We do know, from when Andrew Gilligan popped round for tea in 2011, that Assad used to live in a ""large-ish suburban bungalow"" on an unguarded street. It was decked out with leather sofas, on which the president sat and joked while wearing jeans, in a you-can-call-me-Bash kinda way.

Rumours abound that, since he launched a grand massacre of his own people, Assad has upgraded his quarters and taken to hiding out elsewhere. Some think he has fled to live on a warship guarded by the Russian navy. Others say he has retreated to a fortified base near the coastal town of Latakia, his ancestral home.

Some clues may be gleaned from the shots that the budding snapper-despot has been uploading on to his new Instagram account. He joined the service last month and has already racked up 38,000 followers, to whom he reveals snippets of his banal daily routine. Here he is having a go with a trowel, or chilling out on the sofa with his favourite athletes. Keen to reinforce his academic credentials, he has posted an archive photo of himself preparing for his GCSEs. Elsewhere, he is shown congratulating soldiers on their fine demolition jobs and inspecting his handiwork in hospital, while his saintly wife doles out hot food to the hungry.

But in this contrived torrent of at-home-with-Assad – a nascent social media strategy that also includes a Twitter feed and YouTube channel full of clips of him blowing things up to dramatic music – not much is given away about the nature of the presidential palace. So, in honour of the passing of David Frost, we attempt to go through the Assad keyhole and ask: ""Who lives in a house like this?""

While Gilligan was given the bungalow treatment, heads of state have been ritually summoned to a hilltop fortress that sprawls across the plateau of Mount Mezzeh to the west of Damascus. Surrounded by a high security wall studded with guarding watchtowers, the New Shaab Palace stands gleaming above the city like a modern Acropolis. Designed in 1975–9, and completed in 1990, it is the work of celebrated Japanese architect Kenzō Tange – who, ironically, is perhaps best known for designing the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, built in 1955. Tange resigned before construction began, leaving the project to be interpreted and remodelled by successive contractors, but it retains the hallmarks of his stripped, structuralist approach.

The complex was commissioned by Bashar's father, Hafez Al-Assad, who reportedly wasn't happy with the result. Paranoid about being assassinated as a sitting duck on top of the hill, he never lived there, claiming the palace wasn't intended for him, but for his successor. That was originally planned to be his eldest son, Bassel, a playboy thug who would never have the chance to move in: he was killed in 1994, when he crashed his Maserati driving at 150mph.

Composed of vast white planes of Carrara marble, punctuated by thin arrow-slit windows, the complex is scaled with a pompous monumentality unexpected of Hafez, a so-called ""man of simple tastes"". The massive masonry walls define hidden inner courtyards and extend out to frame expanses of tinted glazing at their ends, cantilevered over the hilltop like blank, all-seeing eyes. From the city below, a jumble of concrete apartment blocks and low-rise housing, you cannot escape the sense of being watched over by some mute, panoptic force.

Like every good dictator's palace, the arrival sequence is designed to make visitors feel as small as possible. Guests are driven along a curving road around the base of the hill up to a tall gateway, from where a straight kilometre-long driveway extends on axis to the palace building. Two arcing roads extend off from the drive, describing something of a phallic shaft in plan, visible from Google maps – perhaps a symbolic gesture Tange incorporated before leaving the project, unbeknown to his client.

This interminable drive continues past a series of landscaped terraces up to an agoraphobia-inducing forecourt, where a single star-shaped fountain lies marooned in an expanse of stone paving. From here, steps lead up to a monumental gateway, a blank white portal decorated with a vault of abstracted Islamic muqarnas motifs, the one concession to decoration in this otherwise faceless facade.

Within, the palace is scaled with the echoing monotony of a congress hall. A red carpet leads through a sequence of 20-metre high chambers, dimly lit, each with their own ceremonial entrance and each decorated with a different interpretation of the five-pointed Islamic star in the floor. Like Assad's Instagram account, it is bleached of any nuance or identity, all as soulless as any corporate office lobby. As one American journalist put it, ""it's like entering the Emerald City of Oz, as remodelled by the North Koreans … a cold and intimidating fortress, empty except for scurrying aides.""

A report from 1989 claimed that one room was fitted with 125,000 marble tiles, at $85 a tile – equating to $10.6m for a single room. Rumours from the same time suggest the entire complex could have cost up to $1bn, all funded by Saudi oil money.

Yet it is a billion-dollar home that, reportedly, has never been loved or lived in by any of the Assad clan. Assad senior is said to have been particularly annoyed by the 25-foot-long staircase that led up to his office. ""He said how could he expect visitors to walk up it?"" said a diplomat at the time, adding that it might have been the opulence that put him off living there. ""He's not particularly into conspicuous consumption,"" he said. ""His office is crummy. Just a square room and few sofas. And he lives in a rundown, dingy, small apartment building"" – conditions, it sounds likely, that the besieged Bashar is only too keen to return to.

It may not be that homely, but at least it will make a majestic series of basketball courts when the Americans move in.","Oliver Wainwright: Designed by celebrated architect Kenzō Tange, what does the Syrian presidential palace say about the Assad regime?",65.0,0.8181818182,1.3636363636,high,medium,abstractive,architecture

THIS is the moment a gigantic 33-FEET-long anaconda was found by terrified builders on a construction site in Brazil.

The huge reptile, which weighs in at at a whopping 63 stone, was discovered by the workers after they carried out a controlled explosion in the Cave of Altamira in the northern state of Para.

Video footage taken by one of the crew pans down the snake's enormous body - which measures one metre in diameter.

After making the frightening discovery, the workers chained the animal to a crane and later lifted it up to reveal its yellow spotted under belly - a move which was criticised in the comments when the clip was uploaded to YouTube.

It's claimed the builders killed the snake rather than leave it in its natural habitat but this has not been confirmed.

Others believe the animal may have died in the explosion, possibly being hit by falling debris, as its head appeared flat in the video footage.

One user wrote: ""I'm not sure this is real, but if it is, shame on these people for killing it! A snake that big has probably been alive for a very long time now, just to be killed for a few pictures? What a waste.""

Another said: ""Human be like 'oh look a giant rare snake and it maybe the last species on this earth, so lets kill it and show it to the world'.""

The Guinness World Record for the longest snake in captivity is currently held by Medusa, a snake in Kansas City, US, which measures 25 feet 2in long.

-The anaconda is a member of the boa constrictor family -South America’s green anaconda is the largest snake in the world -The reticulated python can reach similar lengths but isn’t as fat -They have been known to grow to 29ft and weigh 227kgs -The females are larger than the males -They typically live in swamps, marshes and slow moving streams in the tropical rain forests -They eat wild pigs, deer, birds, turtles and even jaguars -Anacondas are nonvenomous constrictors -They can go months without food after a big meal -Their lifespan in the wild is about 10 years

The baby was found just hours after a little girl was discovered in another building by rescuers, with the capital city having been reduced to ruins after being hit by 600 airstrikes in three days.

Rescuers could be heard shouting in excitement when they realised they had found the baby alive.

The baby girl had her head supported as she was taken out of the rubble with emergency crews rushing to treat her.

Her current condition is unknown.

The rescue came just hours after a little girl's ponytail was found by rescue crews sifting through the rubble, with her distressed cries driving them to dig her out as fast as possible.

The little girl, Rawan Alowsh, was rushed down the road, taken to a van for medical treatment.

Her family, including her father, Mohammad Alowsh, 28, and her mother, 30-year-old Kefaeh, as well as three sisters and one brother, were killed in the attacks.

The White Helmets, Syria's volunteer rescuers, said the bombing was the worst since the conflict began.

The Syrian army announced this week that it would launch an offensive to take the rebel-held east of the city, saying it would take ""all measures to facilitate the reception"" of civilians.

At least 27 people were killed in the airstrikes.

Hundreds more are believed to be killed or trapped within the rubble as emergency services battle to free them.

An eight-month-old baby, his nine year-old brother and their parents are feared to have been among the dead after being buried by rubble as they slept in the village of Accumoli.

Dozens of buildings collapsed in the town of Amatrice – near the popular tourist city of Perugia – trapping scores of locals in the debris.

At least 120 are confirmed dead in the settlement following the 6.2 magnitude tremor according to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Wednesday afternoon.

One of the first victims named was 18-month-old baby Marisol Piermarini, who was killed as she slept in her cot.

She was on holiday in the town with her parents. Both are severely injured.

Grandfather Massimo Piermarini, who tried to save the family, said: ""They did not want me to go in because it was all in danger, but I said that I did not care at all, I had to go looking for them, but unfortunately for the girl there was nothing to do.""

Several other surrounding towns and villages were virtually wiped off the map.

One tourist visiting the scene likened it to the vision of hell as imagined by Italian poet Dante Alighieri.

Agostina Severo said: ""We came out to the piazza, and it looked like 'Dante's Inferno'. People crying for help, help. Rescue workers arrived after one hour... one and a half hours.""

Rescuers have reported hearing the voices of those trapped beneath the rubble as the local mayor declared: ""My town isn't here anymore.""

One witness said they heard kids screaming from beneath the rubble as desperate rescuers dug them out with their bare hands.

Emiliano Grillotti said: ""I can hear one of the children screaming.""

The quake was so strong it could be felt in Rome - 100 miles away - and even as far as Croatia.

Buildings in the Italian capital shook for 20 seconds, according to La Repubblica.

The epicentre was in the Umbrian town of Norcia with the town of Accumoli also badly affected.

More than 100 people remain unaccounted for in the village of Arquata del Tronto.

Its mayor Aleandro Petrucci said: ""It's a disaster.

""We are trying to evacuate the village and move them to a sports field. I've just arrived and I feel like crying.

""I've never seen such an apocalyptic scene except for the L'Aquila earthquake on television.""

Amatrice mayor Sergio Pirozzi told RAI: “Three quarters of the town is not there anymore.

“The aim now is to save as many lives as possible. There are voices under the rubble, we have to save the people there.”

Brit Tourists reported feeling the tremors as far as Rome, with a number taking to Twitter to voice their concerns.

Sarah Conrad said: ""Pretty sure I was just woken up by an earthquake in Rome.

""I thought someone snuck into my hotel room & was jumping on the bed. Both scary!""

Paul O'Halloran, also in Rome, added: ""Just got woke up by an earthquake! Bed and window shutters moving!""

Brit Emma Tucker, who was in the area at the time, said: ""It was pitch dark, very cold. Nobody in our group had a clue what to do in an earthquake.""

Renata Moriono told the Guardian: ""I am on holiday in my home village in the Marche region, a few kilometres away from Amatrice and the epicentre. I felt a very strong shaking at about 3am ... It went on for ages - then again about 1/2 hour or 45 min later. It was like 1997. Terrifying.""

It is thought the epicentre of the quake was about 4km beneath Accumoli (Rieti), which is now almost inaccessible.

Italy is one of the most seismically active countries in Europe and has seen many devastating earthquakes.

This morning’s quake in Amatrice has killed dozens and left hundreds trapped under rubble in the devastated village.

Earthquakes result from weaknesses in the earth’s crust, such as those that run all the way up the spine of Italy.

When these weaknesses fracture they trigger earthquakes.

Italy sits on the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and African Plate, giant rock structures which make up part of the earth’s shell.

The Alps mountain range is formed where these two plates push together, which they are still doing at a rate of 3cm a year.

Minor tremors are common in the country, but events such as today’s magnitude 6.2 quake remain relatively rare.

The last major earthquake to hit the country was in 2012. The magnitude 6 quake in Medolla killed 20 people.

In 2009 a magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit the medieval city of L’Aquila killing close to 300 people.

The site of the 2009 quake is just an hour’s drive from today’s earthquake, in one of the most seismically active regions of the country.

The 2009 quake is believed to have been caused by huge rock faces jerking away from each other.

There have been 18 recorded earthquakes in Italy in the last decade, ranging from magnitude 4.6 to magnitude 6.3.

One of the most devastating was in 1908 when the Sicilian town of Messina was destroyed. Estimates suggest this quake could have killed up to 100,000 people.

Local media suggests it struck at around 3.30am.

The first victims emerged as an elderly couple in Pescara del Tronto, in the Marche region, ten miles from the epicentre.

A family of four were also reportedly dead in Accumoli - four miles from the source of the quake, which struck at 3.30am local time.

Tremors also destroyed homes in Amatrice, where dozens more are feared dead.

The town's mayor Sergio Pirozzi said: ""Half the town is gone.""

He added: ""There are people under the rubble... There's been a landslide and a bridge might collapse.""

Pope Francis cleared his schedule to lead pilgrims in prayer for the victims.

The pontiff expressed his shock and pain as he addressed the St Peter's Square crowd with a rosary bead in his hand.

Tommaso della Longa, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said a grim scene is emerging from Amatrice this morning.

He said: ""The picture we got from our delegate in Amatrice are telling us a terrible story of a small city almost completely destroyed,"" he said.

""The situation is difficult at the moment.

""These areas are in central Italy and are in middle of mountains and valleys.

""There are small houses in the middle of the valley that are completely alone and they need help. It'll take some time to reach them.""

He added finding survivors is a priority. Local eyewitness Lina Mercantini of Ceselli in Umbria, told Reuters news agency: ""It was so strong. It seemed the bed was walking across the room by itself with us on it."" The British Foreign Office updated its advice for anyone stuck in the affected area.

It said on its website: ""An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2 struck Central Italy during the early hours of 24 August. The earthquake was also felt in Rome.

""If you are in the affected area, you should follow the advice of the local authorities. If you are in Italy, Civil Protection have activated a hotline 800840840 for information.

""To learn more about what to do before, during, and after an earthquake visit the Protezione Civile website.""

Data from previous quakes suggest the damage could be significant, according to the USGS.

In 2009, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake in the Aquila region, which was also felt in the Italian capital, left more than 300 dead.

MURDEROUS Mexican gangsters have dropped ice boxes containing SEVERED HEADS outside government buildings near the holiday resort of Acapulco.

The chilling threat from Los Jefes, or The Bosses, was targeted at “traitors” and “blackmailers” according to a warning note left near the boxes.

They were discovered in the city of Chilpancingo in the province of Guerrero early on Sunday morning.

Three headless bodies were later found nearby, with police still working to identify the victims.

It is the latest in a string of gruesome murders carried out by bloodthirsty Mexican gangs in the region popular with tourists.

Guerrero state, home to the famous pacific coast resort of Acapulco, is a bloody battleground for drugs gangs.

They are viciously warring over who has control of trafficking routes between South America and the US.

Gang clashes have led to the deaths of up to 100,000 people over recent years.

The severed head threat is the most high-profile show of brutality since 43 students disappeared in Iguala, Guerrero in 2014.

Police opened fire on students protesting education reform on the orders of the town’s mayor José Luis Abarca Velázquez, according to official reports.

It's thought those that survived were handed over to criminal gangsters in cahoots with local authorities and murdered.

Over 80 people have been arrested over an alleged role in the conspiracy -- half of which are police officers.

ISIS thugs have executed another civilian accused of being gay.

In the latest atrocity in Kirkuk, Iraq, a man was thrown to his death from the top of a high building, and his corpse stoned with rocks by ISIS loyalists on the ground.

The aftermath of the shocking execution was captured on camera, broadcast by Middle Eastern press agency ARA News Network.

The report states: “He was thrown off a roof in front of dozens of people.

“Then ISIS militants called on the people to stone the victim, although he was already dead.

“They started to barbarically stone his corpse.”

The punishment is usually decided upon by Sharia Law, although the circumstances of this particular death have not been independently verified.

Children were seen at the scene watching the disturbing execution take place.

This is not the first time ISIS have killed gay men in Syria and Iraq.

Earlier this year in Aleppo, Syria, a blindfolded man accused of homosexuality was thrown from a 10-storey building.

And in January also in Syria, a 15-year-old boy accused of being gay suffered a similar fate – but the Jihadi terror commander who raped him was spared.

The same month another ‘gay man’ was executed by being thrown to his death in Iraq after being arrested and subject to a mock trial.

In Turkey earlier this month three suspected ISIS terrorists were arrested over a plot to attack the Istanbul Trans Pride parade.","ISIS thugs have executed another civilian accused of being gay.

Lost or severely damaged in the shaking were ancient Roman walls, Gothic and Baroque churches and centuries-old paintings crushed beneath tons of brick, sandstone and marble.

Italian Premier Matteo Renzi said the nation’s “soul is disturbed” by the series of quakes, starting with the deadly Aug. 24 event that killed nearly 300 people, two back-to-back temblors on Oct. 26, and the biggest of them all, a 6.6-magnitude quake that shook people out of bed Sunday morning. It was the strongest quake to hit Italy in 36 years.

There were no reports of fatalities — a fact attributed to the evacuation of sensitive areas and fragile city centers. Nearly 8,000 people have been moved to shelters or hotels following the quakes last week and Sunday, and Italy’s Civil Protection agency was expecting that number to reach 11,000 by Monday morning. Many who stayed behind were sleeping in campers or other vehicles, out of harm’s way.

Renzi vowed to rebuild houses, churches and business, saying, “a piece of Italian identity is at stake at this moment.”

“Feeling the earth collapse beneath your feet is not a metaphorical expression but is what happened this morning, and half of Italy felt this,” Renzi said.

The quake struck another painful blow to the rich artistic heritage of villages that dot the Apennine Mountains.

The worst damage was reported in Norcia, a town in Umbria closest to the epicenter. Two churches were destroyed — the 14th century Basilica of St. Benedict, built on the traditional birthplace of St. Benedict, founder of the Benedictine monastic order; and the Cathedral of St. Mary Argentea, known for its 15th century frescoes. Only the cracked facades were still standing, with most of the structures disintegrating into piles of rubble and dust.

Television images showed nuns rushing into the main piazza as the bell tower appeared on the verge of collapse. Later, nuns and monks knelt in prayer in the main piazza. A firefighter appealed to a priest to help keep residents calm in an effort to prevent them from looking for loved ones.

When the quake stuck, nuns from the Saint Mary of Peace monastery in Norcia were praying and singing hymns. The shaking caused their building to collapse and badly damaged their sleeping quarters. Later, firefighters escorted them back inside to retrieve holy books. Then an aftershock hit.

“But we had courage, because we were in our house and the Lord protects us,” one nun told The Associated Press.

Large sections of Norcia’s ancient Roman city walls — which suffered damage and cracks in the previous quakes — crumbled, along with towers.

Amatrice, the town that bore the brunt of destruction on Aug. 24, sustained blows to treasures that had withstood the quakes of the past weeks.

The community’s medieval bell tower stood tall amid the rubble after the August quake, becoming a symbol of hope and resilience for the stricken population. During a visit to the quake zone earlier this month, the pope prayed alone amid the rubble, the brick tower still standing in the background. But the latest shaking partially collapsed it. The 15th century Church of Sant’Agostino also fell down.

“The monster is still there,” Amatrice Mayor Sergio Pirozzi told Sky TG24.

The quake was felt as far north as Salzburg, Austria, and all the way down the Italian peninsula to the Puglia region, the heel of the boot. In Rome, some 150 kilometers (95 miles) away, people rushed into the streets in pajamas.

The basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls, a site of Christian worship in Rome since the 4th century, had to be closed for inspections after sustaining cracks and damage to some molding. There were also cracks in the cupola of Sant’Ivo alla Sapienza church in Rome, a baroque masterpiece by Francesco Borromini, an architectural giant of the 17th century.

The quake forced the temporary closure of some of Rome’s most important tourist sites, including the presidential palace, so authorities could check for damage.

The crowds in St. Peter’s Square interrupted Pope Francis with applause when he mentioned the quake during his weekly Sunday blessing.

“I’m praying for the injured and the families who have suffered the most damage, as well as for rescue and first aid workers,” he said.

ANSA reported that the quake damaged the church of St. Joseph in Jesi, a town encircled by medieval walls southwest of the coastal city of Ancona. The roof caved in partially and cracks appeared near the altar.

In Tolentino, there was visible damage to the Cathedral of San Catervo and the Basilica of St. Nicolas, which contains artwork and architectural elements dating from the 14th to the 17th centuries.

With a preliminary magnitude of 6.6, it was the strongest earthquake since a 6.9 temblor near Naples killed some 3,000 people on Nov. 23, 1980.

Some 20 people suffered mostly minor injuries. Authorities responded with helicopters to help the injured and monitor collapses, as many roads were blocked by landslides.

The Salaria highway, one of the main highways in the region, was closed at certain points. Some local rail lines in Umbria and Le Marche were also closed as a precaution.

Seismologists said the shaking came from a series of faults in the Apennines, and they could not rule out more, possibly stronger quakes in the near future.

“It is normal for the Apennines,” said the president of Italy’s National Institute for Geophysics and Vulcanology, Carlo Doglioni. He cited a similar sequence of three events within a period of months in 1703 in the region.

Natural law dictates that after such an event there will be more quakes, “which means we can expect some 5 magnitude quakes and many of magnitude 4,” Doglioni said.

Already on Sunday, more than 200 other seismic events were recorded by the institute, including 15 temblors between magnitude 4 and 5.

In his book It’s Not All About “Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone he simply and clearly spells out methods for connecting with people.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the methods.

Nobody wants to feel trapped in an awkward conversation with a stranger.

Robin often begins a conversation with something along the lines of “I’m on my way out but before I left I wanted to ask you…”

Via It’s Not All About “Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone:

Have you ever been sitting in a bar, an airport, a library, or browsing in a bookstore when a stranger tried to start a conversation with you? Did you feel awkward or on your guard? The conversation itself is not necessarily what caused the discomfort. The discomfort was induced because you didn’t know when or if it would end. For this reason, the first step in the process of developing great rapport and having great conversations is letting the other person know that there is an end in sight, and it is really close.

Make sure your words and body language are aligned and both are non-threatening.

A simple smile is the most powerful nonverbal technique, as Dale Carnegie let us know.

Via It’s Not All About “Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone:

When you walk into a room with a bunch of strangers, are you naturally drawn to those who look angry and upset or those with smiles and laughing? Smiling is the number one nonverbal technique you should utilize to look more accommodating. In Dale Carnegie’s book, “How to Win Friends and Influence People” it is principle number two of six.

Quick speech can sound nervous and jumpy, not confident. Crazy people speak quickly; self-assured people speak slowly.

When individuals speak slowly and clearly, they tend to sound more credible than those who speak quickly.

When a request is small, we naturally feel a connection to those who ask us for help.

Have you ever felt a pang of guilt for turning down someone seeking help? I have personally found that there is no greater theme and tool for eliciting individuals for action, information, and a great conversation than the use of sympathy or assistance. Think for a moment about the times in your life when you have either sought assistance or been asked to provide it. When the request is simple, of limited duration, and non-threatening, we are more inclined to accommodate the request. As human beings, we are biologically conditioned to accommodate requests for assistance.

Avoid correcting people or anything that could be interpreted as one-upmanship.

Just listen. You don’t need to tell your story; just encourage them to keep telling theirs.

Suspending your ego is nothing more complex than putting other individuals’ wants, needs, and perceptions of reality ahead of your own. Most times, when two individuals engage in a conversation, each patiently waits for the other person to be done with whatever story he or she is telling. Then, the other person tells his or her own story, usually on a related topic and often times in an attempt to have a better and more interesting story. Individuals practicing good ego suspension would continue to encourage the other individual to talk about his or her story, neglecting their own need to share what they think is a great story… Those individuals who allow others to continue talking without taking their own turn are generally regarded as the best conversationalists. These individuals are also sought after when friends or family need someone to listen without judgment. They are the best at building quick and lasting rapport.

The simplest way to do this is to listen.

Via It’s Not All About “Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone:

The simplest validation that can be given to another individual is simply listening. The action doesn’t require any proactive effort aside from the incessant need each of us has to tell our own story…

The difficulty most of us have is keeping from interjecting our own thoughts, ideas, and stories during the conversation. True validation coupled with ego suspension means that you have no story to offer, that you are there simply to hear theirs.

One of the key concepts that every great interviewer or conversationalist knows is to ask open ended questions. Open ended questions are ones that don’t require a simple yes or no answer. They are generally questions that require more words and thought. Once the individual being targeted in the conversation supplies more words and thought, a great conversationalist will utilize the content given and continue to ask open ended questions about the same content. The entire time, the individual being targeted is the one supplying the content of the conversation.

Dreeke also recommends using a number of standard FBI active listening techniques you can read about here.

Some people don’t speak much. Other times you listen too well and people feel self-conscious about talking so much.

In these two cases it’s good to give a piece of personal information for every one they reveal to get a flow going.

Via It’s Not All About “Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone:

In my experiences, there are really only two types of situations where I have utilized quid pro quo. The first and more common of the instances is when you attempt to converse with someone who is either very introverted, guarded, or both. The second instance is when the person you are conversing with suddenly becomes very aware about how much they have been speaking, and they suddenly feel awkward. In both instances, giving a little information about you will help alleviate some of the issues.

Reciprocation is deeply wired into human nature. When you offer people something, they will naturally feel the need to help you in return.

Doesn’t have to be a big box with a bow on it. Offering someone anything, tangible or not, counts.

Via It’s Not All About “Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone:

Most people would feel badly if they received a gift and forgot to say or send a thank you note to the giver. When someone does you a favor you most likely want to reciprocate with gratitude. Great rapport builders and conversationalists use this desire proactively during every conversation. This technique, coupled with ego suspension, are the cornerstones for building great relationships. This is also the easiest technique to utilize, because gifts come in many forms, from non-material compliments, to tangible material gifts.

If you don’t manage your expectations properly it can lead to disappointment, resentment and anger.

Play it cool. Focus on the other person’s needs and don’t let your expectations rise.

Via It’s Not All About “Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone:

When we are able to shift or manage our expectations, we reduce potential disappointment. When we are disappointed, we sometimes get angry and may even hold grudges and get hurt feelings. These emotions are not conducive to healthy or long term relationships. These emotions are definitely not conducive to developing quick rapport. The best technique to avoid these emotions is to manage expectations.

A number of the ten methods are similar to those espoused by other FBI specialists I have interviewed, including former head of international hostage negotiation, Chris Voss, and FBI profiler Jim Clemente.

And what does Robin say is the best attitude to take when trying to build rapport? Make sure the other person walks away better for having met you.

Via It’s Not All About “Me”: The Top Ten Techniques for Building Quick Rapport with Anyone:

Before I use these techniques or send any class out to practice these techniques, I remind myself and them of one everlasting rule that will dramatically increase your probability of success; it is all about them. The only goal I have either for myself or the individuals I teach is that in every interaction the other person should walk away feeling much better for having met you. You should brighten their day and listen to them when no one else will. Build that connection where others wouldn’t and you will have mastered both conversations and quick rapport.

Authorities were trying to determine how many people were at the construction site when the structure crumpled in Canacona, a city about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from the state capital of Panaji, Police Superintendent Shekhar Prabhudessai said.

Witnesses said about 40 workers were at the site.

“It was like an earthquake when the building fell,” witness Ramesh Naik said. “You could not see what exactly had happened because of the dust.”

Police and residents pulled seven bodies from the wreckage, while firefighters and rescue workers were sifting through the debris for survivors.

Ambulances took at least three seriously injured workers to a hospital for treatment.

Prabhudessai said the cause of the collapse had not been determined.

Fact: The fiscal crisis will compel reductions in defense spending. More important fact: How do we do it in ways that make sense?

Economists argue that economic crises do nations a service by clearing the way for innovation, more-efficient production, and faster growth. If that’s true, crises also compel us to see with brutal clarity, what tasks and capabilities are critical and what is simply “nice to do.”

With these points in mind, when it comes to cutting defense, there are really three options:

Option 1. Let the Pentagon’s military bureaucracies drive outcomes. The division of effort among the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines compels its uniformed leaders to view all national policies, even conflict itself, in terms of what the policies attain or fail to attain for the specific Service. As a result, the uniformed military leadership is inclined to reject any serious appraisal of alternatives that changes the military status quo (little if any money saved). Option 2. Politicians can tinker on the margins of the military status quo. Congress avoided confrontation with the four stars in the aftermath of Desert Storm and made the old industrial age force smaller, while retaining a bloated command overhead. Senior military leaders paid for expensive, often failed modernization programs by downsizing soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, leaving intact the enormous bureaucratic command overhead with its Cold War legacy of numerous single-Service headquarters (modest money saved). Option 3. Politicians can leverage the fiscal crisis to reduce redundant bureaucratic overhead, streamline defense investment and, ultimately, cultivate greater war-fighting capability. These measures mean fewer regional unified commands, fewer four-star headquarters and more capability integration across Service lines. In 1947, General of the Army, Dwight David Eisenhower made the salient point: “Separate ground, sea, and air warfare is gone forever.”

Ike was right then…and now.

Eisenhower was right. Sixty-five years later, it’s time to get on with the job and harvest the major financial savings generated by a smart retooling of the U.S. military.

Option 3 is the only option that allows us to see with brutal clarity what’s required and it promises both savings and increased capability. Given that “Jointness” and the unity of effort it is supposed to deliver is largely an illusion, a national reset of defense policy and national military strategy is vital.

This reset must produce an efficient and effective organization of military power for the optimum use of increasingly constrained resources.

Put another way, lawmakers and the White House should view defense cuts as a once-in-a-century opportunity to harmonize defense investments with the evolutionary trends in military technology, organization and command structures, as well as, the nation’s need for fiscal discipline.

It’s time to craft a new military strategy and a new force designed for the post-industrial age.

The top priority in U.S. military strategy is economic prosperity and the technological superiority that economic strength creates. Conflict avoidance is vital to this outcome.

President Eisenhower’s military strategy led him to invest in capabilities that would make American involvement in wars less likely, conserving America’s military, economic and political reserves of strength in the process. In this regard, open-ended missions to install liberal democracy inside failed or backward societies, missions that are prohibitively expensive and likely to fail, must be discarded in favor of U.S. foreign and defense policies that promote both solvency and security.

Constrained budgets demand armed forces that fight together, creating real unity of effort, and its corollary: American military power that is disproportionate to the actual size of the armed forces employed. This statement describes a force designed to maximize war-fighting capability, a force organized around Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR), Strike, Maneuver and Sustainment.

In an operational military context, economy is about integrating existing and future capabilities within an agile operational framework guided by human understanding. It’s about combining ground maneuver forces with ISR, Strike and Sustainment capabilities from all the Services.

The question is how to do it?

– Reduce redundant command-and-control overhead and establish Joint Force Commands.

Standing up permanent Joint Force Commands (JFC) in a reduced number of regional combatant commands bring together the aerospace, naval and land warfare expertise from the four functional areas – ISR, Strike, Maneuver and Sustainment — in one Command within a relatively flat, joint command structure inside the regional unified commands.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta meets Dec. 5 with combatant commanders over breakfast at the Pentagon.

Sir Winston Churchill told his wartime cabinet, “Failure in war is most often the absence of one directing mind and commanding will.” Perhaps, Churchill’s point explains why from March 1942 to April 1945 when there were 15 million men in the Army and Army Air Corps the U.S. had only four four-star generals to command them: Marshall, MacArthur, Eisenhower and Arnold. Today, the U.S. employs 23 four stars to command a combined Army and Air Force of roughly 879,000 soldiers and airmen. The situation inside the Navy and Marines during World War II was similar.

When there were roughly 4.2 million men in the Navy the U.S. had four four-star admirals to command them: Nimitz, Halsey, Leahy, and King, and, until March 1945, 485,000 Marines were led by a three-star named Vandegrift. Today, the U.S. has 10 four-star admirals and five four-star Marine generals for a combined force of roughly 500,000. The small number of commanders elevated to four stars during the Second World War reflected the understanding that no subordinate in an organization should report to more than one boss, that lines of command authority must be clear and uncontested.

Joint Force Commands address this requirement by consolidating the numerous two-, three- and four-star single-service commands into three-star Joint command centers that capitalize on the vast array of strike forces networked with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. However, permanent three-star Joint Force Commands are not a gimmick to justify massive new investments in technology.

The brass-to-grunt ratio is out of whack.

Joint Force Commands are really intellectual constructs with technological infrastructure, the lynchpin in the shift to a 21st Century force centered on integrated operations and Joint military command structures. The faster that command structures can accurately assess a situation, make “good enough” decisions on what to do about it, and act decisively to deal with it, the more lethal and agile the force becomes.

In future conflicts and crises involving capable opponents, there won’t be time in future conflicts for the “pick-up game” that cobbles Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine headquarters together, the approach we used in Iraq and Afghanistan where there were no opposing armies, air forces, air defenses or naval forces. In a confrontation with a great power like China, by the time the U.S. gets its operational construct and “command and control” act in order, one or more great powers will defeat or delay attacking U.S. forces and achieve their own strategic aims. In this strategic setting, competing single-Service commands and ad hoc Joint Task Forces are burdens, not assets when the size of general-purpose combat forces and the fiscal resources to support them is diminishing.

– Build mission focused capability packages for Joint employment.

The fiscal crisis in defense spending creates the opportunity to both economize and expand the Nation’s range of strategic options while reducing costs by constructing a 21st-century scalable, “Lego-like” force design, and a design structured for warfare inside an integrated ISR-Strike-Maneuver-Sustainment Framework.

The future points towards smaller, but more lethal force packages under one-star officers designed for missions of limited duration and scope, not mass armies created for territorial conquest and occupation. Building mission-focused force packages designed to deploy and fight under one star command or the military equivalent of “Legos” that can be assembled into larger joint operational forces is something aerospace and naval forces can do now, but the ground force cannot. Maneuver, Strike, ISR and Sustainment formations become clusters of joint combat power under brigadier generals or rear admirals (lower half).

Future wars require lighter, more agile forces

Generals in the Army and Marines are resistant to Joint Command structures that do not ensure their forces operate under Army or Marine Command Headquarters. But in a world where the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction makes future operations by large concentrations of ground troops dangerous, especially operations from large, expensive fixed installations like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, the deployment of large, unwieldy headquarters ashore to manage WW II troop formations is a liability. Instead, the ground force can make virtue of necessity and create battle groups under one-stars organized around ISR, Strike, Maneuver and Sustainment ashore, formations that operate like ships at sea, mobile, self-contained, and capable of independent operations under Joint Command.

Organizing forces to deploy and fight under Joint Command is the next logical step in the evolution of warfare beyond the ad hoc coordination of Federal Agencies or combined arms, air-ground cooperation, air-sea battle, amphibious and special operations. Eliminating the colonel or captain level of command also offers additional advantages. Not only does the one-star/three-star command structure allow more time for officers to become educated and qualified for Joint operations – something current Service career patterns obstruct – it can also speed promotion to one-star rank.

– Create a predictable revenue stream and job creation inside America’s defense industries through Joint Optimized Defense Investments.

There is plenty of evidence that functionally organized military establishments that integrate capabilities across Service lines while simultaneously eliminating unneeded overhead are not only less expensive to operate and maintain, they also reduce duplication of effort with the potential to create sustainable profitability inside America’s defense industries.

The topline in defense investments is going down in real terms, and the pressure to reduce costs will drive government clients to squeeze profits as well. What is needed is a new business model that stabilizes investments, increasing capability returns while offering sustainable profitability. The new business model is intertwined with the implementation of the ISR-Strike-Maneuver-Sustainment Framework.

America’s defense establishment desperately needs stability in modernization programs along with clarity in technology forecasting, the kind of forecasting that promotes a real and substantial return on research and development. Aligning defense investments with evolutionary trends in technology, organization and command structures is an essential feature of creating sustainable profitability. Applying the ISR-Strike-Maneuver-Sustainment Framework as a methodology for investment planning and programming to support informed choices as constrained budgets compel force optimization is an important part of this process.

Thirty years passed between the outbreak of World War I and the dropping of the atomic bomb in 1945. Americans should expect at least as much change in defense technology over the next 30 years. As a result, binding military modernization efforts through massive programs intended to stamp out hundreds or thousands of ideal designs over two decades of production runs is the road to ruin as seen in programs like the Future Combat System.

The Future Combat System: A road to ruin

The point is simple. What works now must triumph over “unobtainium.” Industry can deliver what’s required, but the military leadership must establish attainable requirements.

Welding American military power into a coherent operational framework is essential to save money and rationalize modernization, as well as extract greater capability from the existing force.

Action to achieve this outcome, however, requires tough, courageous decisions from lawmakers and the White House, and this won’t be easy.

As Benjamin Disraeli quipped over a hundred years ago: “Courage is the rarest of all qualities to be found in public life.”

Yet, shrinking resources always means a destructive inter-Service fight inside a fragmented defense policymaking process. Numerous active and retired four-stars, along with their political allies on Capitol Hill, will argue furiously against any change in the way the armed forces are commanded, funded or developed. They will always insist that critical capability gaps could emerge with unknown consequences for American national security.

This form of resistance springs from the natural instinct to protect one’s Service, one’s self, and more especially, the business model and war-fighting status quo one knows.

Mahan: Military services can’t reform themselves

Such behavior validates Alfred Thayer Mahan’s view that “No Service can or should be expected to reform itself.” Still, the risk of doing nothing, of living in the past and extending the life of structures and thinking the nation no longer needs, is far greater and, prohibitively expensive.

In the hundred years after Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, Britain fought many small conflicts against weak enemies within its overseas empire, actions that did nothing to prepare the British armed forces for the great power wars of the early and mid-20th Century. As H.G. Wells recorded laconically, “I think that in the decades before 1914 not only I but most of my generation – in the British Empire, America, France, and indeed throughout most of the civilized world – thought that war was dying out…”

When the British entered World War I, they discovered what it meant to fight a determined enemy with capable armed forces.

Americans should not fall victim to similar illusions.

Building effective military power takes time, resources and imagination.

To be ready for the world that will emerge in the aftermath of today’s global economic crisis requires change in defense to begin now, not in 10 or 15 years. By then, Americans will be confronting powers that opted to exploit the coming “inter-war” period and wisely adjusted to the evolutionary trends in armed conflict.

If it's anything like last week's -- ""The Importance of Leading Differently,"" which featured ""Case Study 1: The career of Stanley McChrystal"" --- he'll prepare Monday by traveling from his home in suburban Washington, taking a run around Yale's New Haven campus, and maybe meeting with some students over pizza and beer.

It's a long way from commanding 100,000 U.S. -- and 30,000 allied -- troops in Afghanistan to commanding a couple of dozen students. But that's what happens when you can't command your tongue, or -- more importantly -- those of your supposedly loyal aides in chats with a reporter from Rolling Stone.

Stanley McChrystal, U.S. Army (ret.)/Leading Authorities

But the former Special Operations officer has picked himself up, dusted off the sting of being the first U.S. military wartime commander fired since Harry Truman cashiered Douglas MacArthur a year into the Korean War in 1951, and is steadily rebuilding his life, associates say (McChrystal declined to be interviewed). His erect stance, gaunt look and short hair makes him recognizable – at least to some people. Following a recent not-cheap dinner for five set up by someone else at a fancy New York steakhouse, the group called for the check. They were surprised when the waiter declined to bring it to them. ""They said `Don't worry about it,'"" an associate recalls. Another diner ""had picked it up – and relayed a `thank you for your service,'"" to an embarrassed McChrystal.

It was a painful ticket to a free meal, but part of a process McChrystal has conducted with his trademark gusto. He has spent the last couple of months decompressing from a demanding military career, rendezvousing with family and friends instead of Afghan tribal chiefs and subordinate officers. Shortly after his farewell ceremony in July (he warned the fellow officers in attendance: ""I have stories on all of you, photos on many, and I know a Rolling Stone reporter""), he spent several days with his parents (his father is a retired Army two-star general) in Tennessee. McChrystal, who turned 56 last month, and his wife, Annie, have returned to one of their favorites places, Gettysburg, where he can run and study history at the Civil War battlefield. In addition to the Yale gig, he and Annie have joined the board of the Bethesda, Md.-based Yellow Ribbon Fund, a charity that aids wounded troops and their families.

McChrystal has ruled out working for a defense contractor, an associate says. ""He wants to give back – that's why he's doing the Yellow Ribbon stuff, the teaching – he might do it at the Army War College, too,"" the former Pentagon colleague says. ""He may do some consulting.""

McChrystal's Yale posting has generated only minor criticism. About a dozen people protested the decision of Yale's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs to make him a senior fellow as the school year began September 1. Omar Mumallah, a junior at Yale, told the New Haven Register that McChrystal shouldn't be cited as a role model. ""If you want a moral voice, a moral leader, somebody who can lead people towards more noble, more peaceful, more righteous ethical conduct, McChrystal is not the guy,"" he said. ""It's just that simple."" McChrystal is teaching a single graduate-level course, Leadership in Operation. The seminars are off the record, Yale has said, and cover topics including leadership, politics and risk. Specific classes will deal with ""Coping with Failure"" (September 27), ""Loyalty, Trust and Relationships"" (November 2), and ""Communicating the Story – the Media Environment"" (November 16).

McChrystal has signed up with a speakers' bureau, and already has about a dozen speech-dates in the works. Associates won't say how much he's paid, but the Leading Authorities website suggests he's cheapest when speaking close to his $1.2 million home in Old Town, Alexandria, Va., just outside the capital, and more on the East and West coasts. Associates wouldn't confirm a report that he's seeking $60,000 per chat.

The Leading Authorities website notes that McChrystal tested out his speaking skills before a critical audience last Thursday: leaders of various associations, who are always seeking speakers for their conventions. ""General McChrystal's talk ended as it started—with a packed room and a standing ovation,"" a press release about his talk concluded. ""If you are interested in inviting him to your event, don't hesitate to give us a call."" (Despite the purported ""full bio"" on the website, it doesn't mention anything about McChrystal's sudden fall from grace, simply noting that he ""retired from the military in August 2010."")

McChrystal and his wife, Annie, at his retirement ceremony/DoD photo

McChrystal gives a little pep talk – and a preview of his taciturn speaking style – in videos on the website. ""I tend to be very direct as I talk,"" he says, adding – perhaps unnecessarily -- that ""my speaking style tends to reflect a fair level of candor."" He's got the Army attitude down pat: ""You make an effort, you make mistakes, you correct the mistakes and you move on and you get better every day."" In what's likely to be a key part of his talks, he speaks of ""plywood leadership"" -- the way the military builds headquarters in the middle of nowhere. ""We could do it fast and we could do it inexpensively and we could do it really flexibly -- we could make it tailored to exactly what the mission was -- and because plywood has those characteristics we could also change it,"" he says. ""We could pick it and we could move it, we could tear it down, we could modify it and without great cost or at great time -- we could make it happen immediately.""

Some McChrystal allies believe he got a raw deal from Obama, but the consensus seems to be that the commander's aides doomed his career with their comments about the nation's civilian leaders. The Rolling Stone article described McChrystal as ""disappointed"" by his initial private meeting with Obama last year, and it quoted an aide describing National Security Adviser — and former Marine commandant — James Jones as a ""clown,"" among other indiscretions.

The Pentagon inspector general is now investigating just how the article came to be: some McChrystal associates have maintained the disparaging comments were off the record, and, in any event, weren't a firing offense given the fact that many were uttered during a mid-war Paris visit where reporter Michael Hastings shared drinks with McChrystal and his aides. Others say his decision – deliberate or otherwise – to tolerate such comments made him unfit to command.

There also have been changes in Afghanistan since McChrystal's departure, and not only in the war plans tweaked by his successor – and former boss -- General David Petraeus. What seems to have garnered the most attention from grunts on the ground was a recent decision to reverse McChrystal's ban on fast-food restaurants like Burger King at major U.S. bases in the country. As a special ops ""snake eater,"" McChrystal and his key aides were used to the austerity of working and living ""outside the wire"" – away from major posts – and some Pentagon officials suggest this ethos played a role in the burger ban (and perhaps in the trash-talking that ended McChrystal's Army career). McChrystal's senior enlisted adviser complained such outlets contributed to an ""amusement park"" atmosphere in a war zone. But his successor, Army Command Sgt. Maj. Marvin Hill, disagreed. ""For troops to be able to go and grab a burger or a piece of chicken or whatever, I don't really think it's that bad,"" he told Stars and Stripes, the Pentagon-published newspaper, last week.

Back in Washington, associates say McChrystal is trying to juggle the ups and downs of being a civilian. ""He likes wearing T-shirts and shorts,"" a friend says, ""so that's one of the best things about being out of the Army."" After years of having Army helicopters and ground vehicles ready to ferry him anywhere, he's also adjusting to the not-always-reliable subway in the nation's capital, where a recent 30-minute ride took three times as long. Despite such hassles, he is trying to keep things in perspective. ""I've spent 34 years with guys who lost their lives, or lost their legs,"" he says. ""I just lost a job.""","Stan McChrystal, the four-star Army general booted from command of the Afghan war in June after derisive comments from him and his staff got him fired by President Obama, launches his second classroom session -- ""The Changing Military"" -- as a Yale University lecturer Tuesday.",33.8076923077,1.0,52.0,medium,high,extractive,architecture

But the most exotic, eye-catching architecture in this Beijing suburb is very Chinese.

""It was voted one of China's ugliest buildings,"" Zhao Pingping says of the bizarre Emperor Hotel, which offers accommodations in the shape of three 10-story, bearded deities representing the Chinese gods of good fortune, prosperity and longevity.

""Some older residents hope the gods can bring good luck and security to our neighborhood, but I prefer modern styles. I could never stay there,"" says Zhao, 30, shuddering as she walks past the hotel with her infant son.

An urbanization drive perhaps unparalleled in human history has turned China into a continent-sized construction site. Some of the new buildings have won international acclaim, such as Beijing's ""Bird's Nest"" stadium built for the 2008 Olympics. But far too many are eyesores, complain architects and online critics.

When the architecture website www.archcy.com asked readers to vote for China's top 10 ugliest buildings, Li Hu, a Beijing-based partner at U.S. Steven Holl Architects, said, ""Choosing 10 is very hard, choosing a million is perfectly possible.

""Development is too quick. Architects don't have time to reflect,"" says Li, who blames the ugly edifices in part on interference by government officials, a lack of imagination by architects and corruption. ""A more serious problem than the visual impact is that old buildings are being torn down and new ones built blindly.""

China's imperial palaces, temples and Great Wall help make this country of 1.3 billion people one of the world's top tourism draws. But cities, where more than 50% of the population lives, have lost their historic hearts. Traditional structures have been shorn from cities and replaced by nondescript, blocky modernity.

Like the kitsch found along roadways throughout the USA, the more unusual new buildings in China were designed as calling cards for towns thirsty for attention from tourists and investors. Giant liquor bottles, teapots and lumberjacks may hardly shock Americans who've been to Las Vegas, but they rile some Chinese.

Developers copy designs ranging from Beijing's Tiananmen Gate to the U.S. Capitol and the Sydney Opera House, says Sun Lei, an architect and teacher in Shandong, east China.

""Many cities excessively pursue strange and unique buildings because leaders believe they are good for raising their city's renown and speeding the development of related industries,"" he says.

""Some designs can't be realized even in the West, but places in China spend hugely on them,"" Sun says, citing ""foreign rubbish"" such as the CCTV headquarters designed by Rem Koolhaus somewhat in the shape of a boxy upside-down pair of pants.

Exploiting China's rich heritage can be tricky.

The Fang Yuan building in northeast Shenyang resembles an old Chinese coin: round with a square hole in the middle. It won no accolades. In January, a CNN website named the building one of the 10 ugliest buildings in the world.

""Beauty is different to different people,"" said Wang Zhanshan, chief engineer of another giant coin-shaped building underway in Guangzhou, the Guangdong Plastics Exchange. ""If the building is discussed before and after its completion, it will have already proved it is a successful piece of architecture.""

Among the most dramatic designs are the luxury hotels sprouting nationwide. Futuristic buildings are under construction on man-made Phoenix Island, a resort in Hainan Province. One developer is assembling hotels shaped like giant trees.

""Developers here are not constrained by preconceived notions of what a five-star hotel should look like,"" says Canadian John Jeakins, whose company, Hospitality Associates, helps Chinese clients design, decorate and manage hotels. ""If your color scheme is purple, let's make a purple hotel. In the U.S., people might want to open a restaurant; here, people have more money, so they want to open a hotel.""

One reason for the structural oddities is that the profession of architectural design has a limited tradition. Architect Wu Lianyong told the China Daily that China's architectural style was greatly influenced by the Soviet Union, which discouraged charismatic individual design before its demise in 1991.

""It has now led to an outburst of fancy for the avant-garde, chic and novel,"" Wu says.

Many Chinese see the expenditure on excessively large official buildings, of sometimes bizarre design, as a problem, especially in poorer parts of China.

""So much money is wasted on fancy public buildings, when many people are still so poor,"" Yanjiao's Zhao Pingping says.

Other residents have warmed to the Emperor Hotel's three gods, now dwarfed by a development over the road.

""I was shocked at first,"" says Li Shuang, 27. ""But now I'm used to it. I don't think it's ugly, and my 4-year-old daughter loves it!""",An urbanization drive has turned China into a continent-sized construction site,76.4615384615,1.0,8.3846153846,high,high,extractive,architecture

My green house project gets building permit,1970-01-01 00:33:30.070119,"Finally. After waiting more than five months, my husband Alex and I received a building permit -- the green light -- for our green house project.

I got a voice mail a few days ago from a city official in Falls Church, Va., informing us that our January application had been approved. My builder Arjay West also e-mailed the good news, adding: ""I can hardly believe it.""

""Woo-hoo!"" cheered my architect Heather Daley.

Did I jump for joy? Did I hoot and holler, knowing I could finally tell folks we're breaking ground? Did we celebrate with margaritas and shrimp jambalaya at our favorite Falls Church hangout, Clare and Don's Beach Shack?

I continued straightening our rental townhouse, and when Alex got home from work, I casually mentioned, ""Oh, we got the permit,"" after recapping the day's events.

We simply had waited too long. I was full of anticipation January 15th when I walked confidently into the red brick City Hall and dropped off our grading plan and, a week later, our construction set, but the subsequent process was so draining, frustrating and mystifying that I lost enthusiasm.

""If something anticipated arrives too late it finds us numb, wrung out from waiting, and we feel - nothing at all. The best things arrive on time,"" wrote Dorothy Gilman in 1978's A New Kind of Country.

My thoughts exactly. I've described our journey as a sort of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" down-the-rabbit-hole experience, much of it having absolutely nothing to do with the building of an ultra-efficient house.

We got bogged down in endless bureaucratic details, many of them about protecting trees on our property. As someone building a green home, I'm sensitive to the issue. Really, I am. Still, I had more conversations with the city arborist than with the building official and city engineer combined. The arborist was the last city official to OK our building permit.

In a May post citing reader criticism of my project, I mistakenly wrote that we expected to ""break down"" that month when I meant to say ""break ground."" George Southern, a columnist of the Falls Church Times who has been following my project, jokingly asked if my mistake was intentional. ""No,"" I told him, but I wondered whether my sub-conscious was talking.

We break ground. As I've mentioned, the old house that stood on the property has been deconstructed (see above video) with much of its salvaged materials sent to warehouses in Baltimore for resale. My builder Arjay had the foundation's concrete busted up and hauled off to a facility that will make gravel from it.

Arjay and Heather are now having onsite ""construction"" meetings to plan for the arrival of our Structural Insulated Panels or SIPS, which are factory-built wall and roof assemblies.

Now that we have a building permit, my enthusiasm is starting to return. It's as if, having spent so much time in The Waiting Room of Dr. Seuss' Oh The Places You'll Go, I'm ready to move on.

Based on ballistic tests and other evidence, ""it appears that all nine of the victims were struck either by fragments or by bullets fired by police,"" Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Saturday.

Investigators were trying to piece together what caused Johnson to ambush former colleague Steve Ercolino, a vice president at the company where Johnson was laid off last year.

Police said Johnson hid behind a car and killed Ercolino with five gunshots as he arrived for work. Johnson then walked away before being shot by two police officers who confronted him moments later.

Security camera footage showed the officers had only an instant to react when Johnson turned as they approached and pointed his gun at them, his arm cocked as if to fire.

Their encounter was over in eight seconds. The officers, who had been standing nearly close enough to shake hands with Johnson, fired almost immediately.

Nine bystanders were wounded in the 16-shot volley, all by stray or ricocheting police bullets. None of their injuries was life-threatening, police said.

The officers who fired were part a detail regularly assigned to patrol landmarks since the Sept. 11 attacks, officials said.

Kelly, the police commissioner, said the officers who confronted Johnson had ""a gun right in their face"" and ""responded quickly, and they responded appropriately.""

""These officers, having looked at the tape myself, had absolutely no choice,"" he said.

A loaded magazine was found in Johnson's briefcase. Johnson legally bought the gun in Florida in 1991, but he didn't have a permit to possess it in New York City, authorities said.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Friday said New York still is the safest big city in the country, on pace to have a record low number of murders this year.

""But we are not immune to the national problem of gun violence,"" he said of the shooting, which followed recent mass shootings at a Colorado movie theater and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.

Johnson was known for spending long hours in the quiet of Central Park, photographing hawks and marveling over nature's beauty.

His victim was a gregarious salesman, beloved by his nieces and nephews as the fun uncle who could talk with equal expertise about the New York Jets and the women's fashion accessories he sold.

By Jean M. Shum, AP

Jeffrey Johnson uses binoculars to search Central Park for the young offspring of popular red-tailed hawk local birdwatchers know as Pale Male. Police identified Johnson as a gunman who killed a former colleague.

Police investigating Johnson's killing of Ercolino were eyeing bad blood between them from when they worked together at Hazan Import, a garment district business where Ercolino was a vice president of sales.

Johnson and Ercolino had traded harassment accusations when they worked together, police said, and when Johnson was laid off from the company a year ago he blamed Ercolino, saying he hadn't aggressively marketed his new T-shirt line.

After Johnson's layoff, neighbors said, he continued to leave his apartment every day in a suit.

Internet records listed Johnson as the administrator of the website for a business called St. Jolly's Art, which sold iron-on graphic art for T-shirts. Art for sale on the site included stylized drawings of fighter planes and muscle cars and whimsical ""seafaring vignettes"" featuring pirate maidens and tall ships.

Johnson also was part of a community of bird watchers and photographers who document hawks and other wildlife living in Central Park, a few blocks from his home.

In one e-mail to another bird watcher who works at the Associated Press, Johnson wrote tenderly about spending a winter night watching ducks in the park.

""Near midnight by the Harlem Meer I watched a little 'flotilla' of Mallards swimming and softly honking … fifteen degree temp and they were carrying on unfazed. Just remarkable,"" he wrote.

His photographs of Central Park's hawk population appeared regularly on blogs tracking the birds.

A neighbor who often saw Johnson, 58, said he was always alone.

""I always felt bad,"" said Gisela Casella, who lived a few floors above Johnson in a modest apartment building on the Upper East Side. ""I said, 'Doesn't he have a girlfriend?' I never saw him with anybody.""

Ercolino, 41, was described by his relatives as the opposite of a quiet loner.

His eldest brother, Paul Ercolino, said he was a gregarious salesman who often traveled, had a loving girlfriend and was the life of any family gathering.

""He was in the prime of his life,"" he said. ""He would do anything for anybody at any time. … He was so wonderful with my children. At Christmastime, he was the one who always had the best presents for the kids.""

Paul Ercolino said his brother, known to nieces and nephews as Uncle Ducky because of his nearly blond hair, had followed his father into the garment industry after growing up in Nanuet, just north of New York City, then later worked in women's handbags and accessories. He said his brother had never mentioned to the family that he had any problems with a co-worker.

Hazan Import Corp. executives didn't return phone calls seeking comment Friday.

Johnson, after waiting for Steve Ercolino to come to work, walked up to him, pulled out a .45-caliber pistol and fired at his head, police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. After Ercolino fell to the ground, Johnson stood over him and shot four more times, a witness told investigators.

""Jeffrey just came from behind two cars, pulled out his gun, put it up to Steve's head and shot him,"" said Carol Timan, whose daughter, Irene Timan, was walking to Hazan Imports at the time with Ercolino.

In security camera footage released by the police, Johnson can be seen walking calmly down the sidewalk after the shooting, distancing himself slightly from the other pedestrians, who appear to have no awareness that anything is wrong.

But when two police officers approach in a hurry, Johnson turns and pulls a handgun from a bag. Then, the scene explodes into action. People seated on a bench behind the gunman and pedestrians standing close to the two officers run for their lives.

Only a young child seems not to react, strolling out of view of the camera as adults all around leap away in terror.

Startled New Yorkers later looked up from their morning routines in the crowded business district to see people sprawled in the streets bleeding and a tarp covering a body in front of the tourist landmark.

""I was on the bus, and people were yelling 'Get down! Get down!"" accountant Marc Engel said. ""I was thinking, 'You people are crazy. No one is shooting in the middle of midtown Manhattan at 9 o'clock in the morning.'""

It was over in seconds, he said — ""a lot of pop, pop, pop, pop, one shot after the other.""

Afterward, he saw sidewalks littered with the wounded, including one man ""dripping enough blood to leave a stream.""

A witness had told police that Johnson fired at the officers, but authorities say ballistics evidence doesn't support that. Johnson's gun held seven rounds, they said. He fired five times at Ercolino, one round was still in the gun and one was ejected when officers secured it, authorities said.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said New York still is the safest big city in the country, on pace to have a record low number of murders this year.

""But we are not immune to the national problem of gun violence,"" he said of the shooting, following mass shootings at a Colorado movie theater and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.

The nine people wounded outside the Empire State Building were all from New York City, except for a woman from Chapel Hill, N.C. They suffered graze wounds or other minor injuries.

Metal detectors and bag searchers have been standard at the Empire State Building since 1997, when a gunman opened fire on the 86th-floor observation deck, killing one tourist and wounding six others before fatally shooting himself.

The skyscraper remained open Friday throughout the mayhem, although its workers became witnesses.

""We were just working here and we just heard bang, bang, bang!"" said Mohammed Bachchu, a worker at a nearby souvenir shop.

He said he rushed from the building and saw seven people lying on the ground, covered in blood.

Rebecca Fox said she saw people running down the street and initially thought it was a celebrity sighting, but then she saw a woman shot in the foot and a man dead on the ground.

""I was scared and shocked and literally shaking,"" she said. ""It was like 'CSI,' but it was real.""

A 12-year-old boy building a snow fort in Upstate New York died after he was trapped in a snow bank, and authorities are trying to determine whether road crews unwittingly dumped hundreds of pounds of snow on him.

Police have not released the name of the boy who was killed or another boy who diggers found alive and unharmed in Greenwich, N.Y., about 40 miles northeast of Albany.

The boys were playing in a private lot where Department of Public Works trucks dump snow collected during the day, according to the Times Union, an Albany newspaper.

The surviving boy, who was responsive and talking, told his rescuers he heard the backup alarm of a truck, then everything went dark, the newspaper reported. The incident remains under investigation.

Arctic air is moving toward the East Coast and could bring record low temperatures later in the week. In upstate New York, the weather proved deadly for a boy who died after getting trapped in a snow bank while sledding. (Reuters)

Someone reported the boys missing about 5 p.m. A search dog found their sled, and first-responders launched a frantic effort to uncover the boys.

“There was probably a dozen-and-a-half men with shovels and bare hand digging, and I think they moved — with no exaggeration — seven tons of hard packed snow in about 10 minutes time,” Greenwich-Cambridge Police Chief George Bell told Albany, N.Y., ABC affiliate WTEN.

[Snow makes for frowns on Northeast roads, smiles on slopes]

The unconscious boy was found first, but paramedics couldn’t resuscitate him at the scene, according to the New York Daily News. He was taken to Saratoga Hospital, but it was too late. He was pronounced dead at 10 p.m.

Earlier this week, a snowstorm that swept into the northeast dumped a foot of snow in parts of the Great Lakes and upper Midwest and left half a foot across New York and northern New England, according to the Associated Press.

Greenwich got snow on Monday and Tuesday, according to The Weather Channel.

The boy’s death was reminiscent of the death of 56-year-old David Perrotto on a snowy January weekend in eastern Pennsylvania.

Perrotto was trying to dig out his car — or possibly taking a break from the exertion or the cold — when a snowplow came by, burying the running car and blocking the exhaust pipe, police told Philadelphia NBC-affiliate WCAU.

Another person digging out a vehicle found the running car with an unresponsive Perrotto inside.

A 7-year-old told her bus driver she couldn’t wake her parents. Police found them dead at home.

They slip into a soporific stupor as you prattle on about potholes and waterways.

Then there are those like yours truly, who, based on our recognition of the importance of public goods and the cost of underinvesting in them, have the opposite reaction. Our pulse quickens at the thought of greater investment in our roads, bridges, public transit, airports and more.

With that typology in mind, perhaps person-type #2 (me) can tell person-type #1 (maybe you) about candidate Hillary Clinton’s new infrastructure proposal in a set of painless bullet points.

What’s the plan? It’s to raise and spend $275 billion over five years on infrastructure investment, with $250 billion in direct spending on new and improved infrastructure and $25 billion on a private/public infrastructure bank (which I’ll explain below).

Why do we need it? The share of our GDP devoted to infrastructure investment, already low in international terms, has fallen by half over the past 35 years, from about 1 percent to 0.5 percent (the Clinton campaign does the weird “China’s gonna eat our lunch” thing here to motivate their plan … I continue to believe that setting up China as our opponent in the race for the future is misguided; the Obama team does the same thing to sell their trade deal).

We could also use the higher-than-average-quality jobs such spending creates (13,000 jobs per $1 billion of infrastructure spending; so more than 3 million jobs over five years from the direct spending part).

The campaign makes a smart point here: We pay a shadow “tax” by failing to make these upgrades.

Our deteriorating roads result in a hidden “pothole tax” that takes over $500 per year out of American families’ pockets because of extra car maintenance. Rush-hour commuters waste hours in traffic annually — costing them nearly $1,000 per year in fuel and other expenses, giving them less time to spend with their families, harming our environment, and damaging public health. Air travelers find themselves delayed and stranded, as more than one in five American flights is either delayed or cancelled altogether. Consumers pay more for everything from food to furniture because of freight congestion in our highways, waterways, and ports. And too many Americans are living in opportunity deserts — finding it difficult to get and keep a job because getting to work means traveling for an hour or more using unreliable, indirect transit systems.

Yes, this stuff costs money. But “not this stuff” costs money, too.

Direct spending on what? The plan calls for direct investment in a wide variety of public goods, i.e., spending private firms are unlikely to undertake as they cannot typically get back a return on investment (ROI). The plan includes road and bridge maintenance (“nearly one in four bridges requires significant repair”), public transit, reducing freight bottlenecks, airports, including “NextGen” air traffic control “that would move our national airspace system from groundbased radar to satellite-based navigation, improve digital communications, and enhance information management,” passenger trains, digital access buildout, and dam and levee maintenance.

What’s the “payfor?” They just say they’re going to pay for this by closing corporate tax loopholes (“business tax reform”). Not much to go on there, but what’s interesting is that this implies they’re proposing revenue-positive tax reform versus revenue neutral. That’s important and necessary.

What’s an infrastructure bank? It’s an “independent, government-owned … bank with a bipartisan board of highly qualified directors authorized to make critical investments in building 21st century infrastructure.” The idea is to bring private capital in from the sidelines to support public infrastructure, so the bank would guarantee loans, provide below-market-cost credit, and issue subsidized bonds (e.g., the feds pay some of the interest on a municipal bond issue thus lowering the cost to the municipal borrower or raising the return to the lender).

This implies both government subsidies as well as user fees to spin off some degree of ROI to investors.

That’s one way to do it, and this may be a worthy idea; it’s certainly worth trying. But the risks are non-trivial (“bipartisan, highly qualified directors” … in the Trump administration??) and there are lots of projects not amenable to user fees. Really, it’s admitting that we can’t raise the revenues we need to support our infrastructure, so let’s craft a scheme to get investors into the game. I prefer the more direct route, but one must recognize political constraints.

On the other hand, advocates correctly argue that such a bank could operate across government silos in efficiency-enhancing ways. My experience in this corner of government work was that it’s much more complicated than it should be to plan for and build, say, a bridge that has a rail line on it.

Is it big enough? The Clinton plan has been criticized for being too small. The American Society of Civil Engineers argues that we need a lot more than $275 billion to close our infrastructure gap — more like four times that amount by 2020. That’s more in the spirit of candidate Bernie Sanders’s plan. In fact, the progressive Campaign for America’s Future provides a useful side-by-side of the two Democrats’ plans, asking “Why So Little?” of the Clinton plan. I suspect the answer lies in our terribly cramped tax debate, as I discuss here; her pledge to raise taxes only on households above $250,000 is likely a constraining factor. Which brings me to:

Does Clinton’s (or Sanders’s) plan have any chance of actually coming to fruition? Historically, partisans have worked together on this stuff, as constituents of varying political stripes tend to support world-class infrastructure. But Clinton’s plan, and even more so Sanders’s, gets trapped by the fact that revenue-positive tax reform is virtually disallowed in our current politics. If we can’t raise new revenue, we can’t add to our infrastructure. We can’t even really maintain it, as seen in the problems with the Highway Trust Fund, supported by an 18.4 cent/gallon tax on gasoline that hasn’t moved (in nominal terms!) since 1993.

As noted, Clinton’s payfor comes from business tax reform and there’s definitely bipartisan interest in that, but many reformers will insist the new plan must be revenue neutral. The Obama folks have an interesting hybrid plan where business tax reform is revenue neutral in the long run but there’s a one-time transition fee — which raises a similar amount to what Clinton proposes here — that’s invested in infrastructure. However, you can be sure others will insist on using this money to shave something more off the rate (which doesn’t make sense, by the way, since a one-time, transitional slug of revenue can’t pay for a permanent tax cut).

The idea that we can expand or maintain public goods in an advanced economy without raising tax revenue is the type of magical thinking we either have to abandon or live with the resultant decline in our productivity, safety, and comfort.

One final point. In comparison to what’s passing for policy discourse these days in the campaigns, you’ve really got to appreciate the detail with which Clinton’s plan was drawn up.

“It took almost two years of tough negotiating, but there was a core group of seven of us in the tenant association that worked with a lawyer to make sure our rights were protected,” Marra says. “We negotiated the right to live in our apartments under rent control for the rest of our lives. Believe me, none of us ever plan to move now. Why would we? We have great renovated apartments and low rent.”

Marra and her neighbors benefited from the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA), a provision in the District that provides strong protection for tenants to avoid a forced move. Elderly and disabled renters receive additional protection under local laws to shield them from eviction or excessive rent increases.

“TOPA was created back in the 1970s to protect tenants from displacement when there was a surge of developers converting apartments to condos,” says Steve Schwat, principal at Urban Investment Partners (UIP) in Washington. “The rule gives tenants the right to buy their building or to assign their right to a third party.”

[What happens when your rental is being converted into a condo?]

Tenants can decide on their own whether they want to buy their building even before an offer is made, but more commonly, a notice is delivered to all tenants when a developer wants to purchase their building. Nonprofit organizations that support low- and moderate-income tenants and seek to preserve affordable housing are notified by the D.C. government when a TOPA notice is sent to tenants.

“A lot of tenants ignore those notices, so we distribute fliers and hold a tenant meeting so they understand their TOPA rights,” says Anita Ballantyne, program director of the multifamily/tenant services department at Housing Counseling Services in Washington.

Tenants who do nothing in response to a TOPA notice will not necessarily lose their homes, she says.

“Renters don’t have to move in D.C. when their building changes ownership, but their leases are transferred to the new owner,” Ballantyne says.

A total of 218 apartment buildings in the city have changed ownership since January 2010, says William Rich, a senior vice president of Delta Associates, a Washington company that tracks commercial real estate sales. (But the company does not track how many of the 214 buildings were converted to condominiums.) Yearly sales rose to 43 in 2013 from 29 in 2010, then dropped to 35 in 2014. Between January and September this year, 31 apartment buildings were sold, Rich says.

“We’re seeing a lot of rental buildings in D.C. changing hands, but they’re not all converting to condos,” says Matt Dewey, vice president of sales with Urban Pace in Washington. “The market for apartment buildings was dead from 2008 to 2011, but we’ve seen an increasing number of high-dollar sales in recent years because the demand for rentals and condos is there. Developers are also more able to obtain financing now than during the recession.”

Dewey says many developers find it easier financially to keep buildings as apartments, renovate them and charge higher rents rather than convert them to condos.

TOPA rules vary according to the size of a building, although all renters have the right of first refusal under D.C. law. The main difference in the rules is that buildings with five or more units have extra time to negotiate before a sale.

If you receive a notice that your building is up for sale, the first step is to form a tenant association and register it with the D.C. government, says Eric Rome, an attorney with Eisen & Rome in Washington. At least 51 percent of the building’s tenants must sign an agreement to form the association.

Ballantyne says tenants have 45 days after the notice of sale to incorporate their association and register their intent to purchase the building. Tenant associations that are already incorporated have 30 days to register their intention to purchase.

“Registering their intent to purchase the building doesn’t commit the tenants to an actual purchase,” Ballantyne says. “However, it’s an essential step to begin the process of negotiating with the person or company who has made an offer on the building and with other potential purchasers.”

[What you need to know before you buy into a condo association]

Ballantyne says the tenant association should hire a lawyer or a nonprofit organization as soon as it has submitted its intent to buy. The tenant association has four months from the date of registering an intent to purchase the building to sign a contract for the sale and make an earnest-money deposit of 5 percent or less of the purchase price. She says the funds for the deposit can come from a developer hired by the tenants or from a nonprofit organization.

Legal fees are typically part of the bargaining between the tenant association and the developer.

“We interviewed four or five developers and chose UIP because they seemed the most willing to work with us,” Marra says. “We were as democratic as possible and voted on everything.”

Rome says most tenant associations interview two to five developer candidates and make a choice in four to six months.

“Tenants have the option to ask for any improvements they want, and they can invite in more than one potential buyer,” says UIP’s Schwat. “A lot of the older apartments in D.C. were built before or just after World War II and still have the original single-pane windows, radiator heat and old electric wiring, so they don’t come close to meeting modern fire code and construction standards.”

Marra and her neighbors persuaded UIP to keep their apartment layouts intact rather than have the interiors become open floor plans. She says the tenants also insisted on keeping the public laundry room in addition to the washer-dryers installed in each apartment and even negotiated individually on customizations such as larger showers instead of combination tubs and showers.

Tenants typically hire an attorney or third-party management company to represent their interests, but they can also work directly with a developer, Dewey says.

“If possible, it’s best to be on the same page as your neighbors, because if one person decides to hold out for more money or a better deal, it can ruin the entire deal,” Dewey says.

In some cases, an extensive renovation will require residents to move into other units or out of the building entirely, Rome says. In that case, the developer typically provides relocation assistance.

Rent control laws in the District mean that rents can be raised above the capped percentage only if a landlord petitions for an increase on the basis of capital improvements, financial hardship or a substantial renovation. But Schwat says that because tenants can challenge a landlord’s petition, the result is typically a year or two of litigation.

One way an owner can avoid petitioning the government is through a voluntary agreement signed by 70 percent of the tenants. A typical voluntary agreement allows the new owners to raise the rent on certain units, usually only as the units become vacant, Schwat says.

“A voluntary agreement can add value for tenants during negotiations, particularly if it’s an older building with very low rents,” Rome says. “It can be a bargaining tool for the tenants and makes it easier for a developer to get financing for the purchase and renovations based on future rents.”

[What to do when your landlord decides to sell]

Rome says there is a debate about whether voluntary agreements are good or bad for the city, but he says it’s in tenants’ interest to sign one. Ballantyne says the city has lost some affordable housing units because of voluntary agreements, but she says sometimes an agreement can be the right thing for some tenants.

“We provide tenants with counseling, information and support so they can make the best decision for themselves,” Ballantyne says. “The philosophical debate is whether current tenants should be able to take vacant units out of rent control with a voluntary agreement.”

Schwat says that although the law requires that 70 percent of tenants sign a voluntary agreement, UIP requires 75 percent of tenants to sign the agreement before moving forward with a transaction.

“Developers don’t actually take advantage of tenants as long as the tenants exercise their rights properly,” Rome says. “There’s a synchronicity of interests between tenants and developers. Good developers have learned that they can get a better deal with the cooperation of tenants rather than [with] hostility.”

In the past, tenants could negotiate to have rental and condominium units in the same building, but the new rules for financing condos limit the number of rental units allowed in a condominium building, Rome says. Also, he says, the purchase price for a building plus renovation costs often makes a conversion to condominiums too costly. However, Rome says it’s easier to convert smaller buildings, those with 12 to 40 units, to a condominium than a building with 80 to 200 units because most of the tenants need to be willing and able to buy units.

“Most long-term tenants prefer to stay in a low-cost, rent-controlled unit, and many younger, newer residents in a rental prefer to take a cash buyout and move to another rental unless the price point is low enough to make the condo more affordable,” Rome says.

Tenant associations typically have the following options:

•Renovated rentals with rent control: Tenants can end up with nicer apartments for the rent they pay now. “Longer-term renters are likelier to stay through a renovation because their rent-controlled apartments are often significantly less expensive than anything they can find at current market rents,” Schwat says.

•Condo conversion: Renters can become homeowners if they can qualify for loans to buy units in their building. “Some people prefer a buyout because they don’t want to buy a home, but usually, the discount for current tenants on the purchase of a condo will be better than the buyout,” Urban Pace’s Dewey says.

•Tenant buyout: A developer can offer to buy out the lease of tenants and give them cash, which can then be used to subsidize a move to another rental or for a down payment on a home purchase. The size of the buyout depends on a variety of factors, including the size of the unit. The typical amount is $15,000 to $25,000, but sometimes the buyout can go as low as $2,500 or as high as $50,000 or even $100,000, Rome says.

“More recent residents often prefer to take a buyout because they can often find another apartment with a similar rent, and then they don’t have to live through the renovation,” Schwat says.

Ballantyne, the housing counselor, cautions that not all options are available in every situation, so sometimes buyouts are not offered. Even when they are, not all renters will benefit from accepting the offer.

“While being handed a large sum of money seems great, it’s important to think about where you will move and what your new rent will be,” she says. “If you have to pay a higher rent, then how long will that buyout last? Also, people often forget that they have to pay taxes on a buyout, which reduces the amount you actually have to spend.”

“Whether you decide to stay as a renter, buy a condo or take a buyout, you should look at the purchase of your building as a unique opportunity,” Dewey says.

Tips for renters faced with the sale of their apartment buildings:

•Take steps to form a tenant association and register it immediately if you receive a notice that your building is for sale.

•Get legal help, either through a nonprofit organization or pro bono legal-assistance group, or by hiring a lawyer to represent the tenant association’s interests. Typically, the legal fees are part of the negotiation and are paid by the eventual purchaser.

•Negotiate as a group through the tenant association for maximum power. Be as inclusive and democratic as possible during the process.

•Have realistic expectations of how much a developer will pay you if you opt for a buyout.

•Be patient and prepared for extensive tenant association meetings to come to an agreement about the developer, options for tenants and prioritizing renovations.

Maryland’s housing laws vary by county. In Montgomery County, for example, the government and tenant groups have the right of first refusal on a rental property that could be sold to a developer, says Robert Goldman, president of Montgomery Housing Partnershipin Silver Spring.

“If a rental building is expected to be sold and converted to a condo or more expensive rentals and that would cause displacement of the residents, the county can step in and buy it to protect the tenants,” Goldman says. “There are also provisions in place to guarantee a three-year tenancy for some tenants and a lifetime tenancy for seniors to prevent displacement.”

Renters can also form an association and negotiate to buy the building if they can arrange the financing.

“The right of first refusal is important because it gives tenants leverage when negotiating for their right to stay in their homes and to keep them affordable,” Goldman says.

He recommends that renters whose building may be sold immediately get legal help and form a tenant association.

Virginia is one of a handful of states that follow “Dillon’s Rule,” which means that local and county jurisdictions can make their own rules only with the approval of the state’s General Assembly, says Dipti Pidikiti-Smith, managing attorney with Legal Services of Northern Virginia in Fairfax.

Any real estate transactions involving rental homes must abide by the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.

“Renters must be notified if their building will be sold, and they have the right to stay in the apartment for 120 days,” Pidikiti-Smith says. “If they haven’t left after 120 days, renters typically have 30 more days before they [can be] evicted if they are on a month-to-month lease. Renters on a year lease will be granted 90 days after the initial 120 days to find another place to live.”

Local jurisdictions in Northern Virginia have enacted some regulations to protect tenants, particularly if they have low income or are elderly or disabled.

“There’s nothing in the law that requires rents to be kept low after a building is sold; there’s no rent control in Northern Virginia,” Pidikiti-Smith says. “It can be very hard for people who have lived in a building for a long time to find a new affordable place to live.”

Pidikiti-Smith recommends that renters who receive a notice about a building’s sale contact their local government office on housing to find out whether they can receive financial assistance for the move or help finding new housing. If a building is being converted to a condominium, the renters must be told the price of their homes, but there is no tenant right of first refusal.

That's how much in cash and coins volunteer coordinator Kristen Sheldon and her troupe of helpers recovered from the bottom of the ball pit ocean once ""The Beach,"" the museum's blockbuster summer art installation that attracted 180,000 visitors, had been removed. And that's just the American money, not counting several ""[e]uros, some loonies, some Thai money,"" said Sheldon. There was also $31 in ""bills that we found halves of"" some of which they reconnected through matching the serial numbers: ""Reverse counterfeiting,"" as Sheldon called it.

[Lost something at the National Building Museum's Beach? It's not the only phone in the sea.]

When I wrote about the items that had been lost to the Davy Jones' Locker of the ball pit last week, readers wrote in to share their own missing items, from pairs of glasses to a child's tooth. Now that the balls have been boxed away -- given to the Dupont Underground for a future art installation -- Sheldon is ready for the final push in her quest to reunite Washingtonians with their long-lost stuff.

Missing a SmarTrip? Sheldon found 31 of them (she has returned them to WMATA). If you lost a baseball cap, chances are, yours may be among the 32 hats she pulled out of the deep. If you lost a wedding ring -- well, you may be out of luck.

""We weren't able to return five of them, which is a bummer,"" she said. There were nine rings reported missing, but only four were found. ""We tried -- oh my goodness, did we try. Everybody involved was so careful.""

She described a scene where volunteers meticulously picked through hairballs and carpet fibers to pull out earring backs and Lego figurine heads. They saved beads from broken jewelry. And in the process, they found some weird stuff: A beheadded Strawberry Shortcake doll. A cigarette butt. A Chuck-E-Cheese token. Two guitar picks. A book of 'Amphibians of North Carolina.' A plastic ear of corn.

""The Beach had a natural filtration system,"" said Sheldon. ""There was a gap at the bottom, and stuff would go underneath that.""

[At the National Building Museum's Beach, you'll have a ball -- or a million of them]

Still, there were many things reported missing that never made it out of the beach, either because they were smashed to pieces under the tremendous force of the balls, or they were taken by another visitor.

""I thought we would find almost all of it,"" she said. ""The fact that a lot of it didn't come up and I don't have a good explanation bugs me."" She's been making some tough phone calls to people who lost jewelry or sentimental items that never surfaced. Sheldon has a message for those who visited ""The Beach"" this summer: ""If anybody did take something that didn't belong to them -- other than cash, because you can't track that -- if they hear the stories of people who lost sentimental things, and want to do the right thing, they can bring it back to the museum, no questions asked.""

So far, the museum has returned 60 percent of the items reported missing. Shoes, she says, are the easiest to reunite with their owners. She plans to hang on to items until the end of October before donating them to charity.

""I would have loved nothing better to return every little piece of every little thing to everyone,"" she said. ""That's not realistic, I guess.""

Still, even when Sheldon couldn't return an item, she has found some creative ways to make up for visitors' disappointment. Take the child who lost his first tooth in ""The Beach."" It was never recovered. But Sheldon is planning to ""send a missive to that young man from the Washington Area Bureau of Tooth Fairies,"" explaining the tooth's disappearance. ""I'll have a little fun with it,"" she said.

The facility was built at Kandahar Airfield and includes four warehouses with a combined 173,428 square feet of storage space, an administration building and other unspecified supporting facilities. It was designed for the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which supplies equipment to U.S. troops at home and overseas.

DLA did not accept delivery of the facility until Feb. 3, 2014, and never used it. “With a few minor exceptions,” the rest of the U.S. military never has, according to the report, which was issued by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR).

[Watchdog releases satellite photos of Camp Leatherneck in Afghanistan, before and after U.S. withdrawal]

“Although the $14.7 million DLA warehouse facility was well built, lengthy construction delays led to the facility never being used for its intended purpose,” SIGAR said. “Had the facility been completed on schedule, DLA would have been able to use the warehouse facility for more than 2 years before its mission ended in Kandahar.”

It’s the latest in a series of SIGAR reports highlighting how U.S. taxpayer dollars were wasted in Afghanistan. In another case, the U.S. military failed to stop construction at a $36 million headquarters building at Camp Leatherneck, in Helmand province, despite a U.S. general saying in 2010 that it wasn’t needed.

Specifications for the warehouse project in Kandahar were first developed in 2009. The Army Corps of Engineers issued a $13.5 million contract in September 2010 to YDA AFCON Joint Venture, a collaboration between two Turkish construction firms. It was supposed to be completed by August 2011, but the firm was slow to complete work and pay subcontractors, SIGAR found.

The military partially canceled the contract with about 92 percent of the work done in April 2013. The Army Corps of Engineers issued a $844,526 contract the following month to complete the project by that August, but eventually modified it to include clean-up services, a more expensive fire suppression system and more employees to test a fire pump system and fire pump controllers. That boosted the overall cost to $14.7 million.

The building wasn’t turned over to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) until Feb. 3, 2014. By then, the U.S. military already was well into cutting down the number of troops and civilians deployed.

SIGAR recommended that Gen. Lloyd Austin, the commander of U.S. Central Command (Centcom), direct U.S. Forces-Afghanistan to identify who made the decision to allow contract modifications that boosted the project’s price tag after the decision was made in August 2013 to end DLA’s mission in Kandahar.

A Centcom official, Army Col. Scott A. Petersen, wrote in a letter to SIGAR that the organization concurred with the watchdog’s findings that the warehouses were well built, but well after deadline. Finding out why the Army Corps of Engineers modified the contract to cost more will require an investigation, but he did not indicate whether Austin will order one.

U.S. Forces-Afghanistan had no comments for the report, according to a letter it sent to SIGAR.

One day the Google chief executive read online that someone a few decades ago had launched a hot-air balloon that circled the world a few times. Why can’t we do that today, he wondered. Soon after his company launched Project Loon, an attempt to provide Internet access via balloons. What once seemed like a harebrained project with a fitting name, now may be only a year away from commercial deployment.

As a Stanford grad student Page famously had the crazy idea to download the whole Internet to a computer in his dorm room. That led to the Google search engine we all know, and made Page a billionaire with the chance to take on even more daring projects.

For fun, Page will sometimes meet up with his Google co-founder Sergey Brin and SpaceX founder Elon Musk to bat around wild ideas, such as a commuter plane that constantly circles the earth.

“It’s kind of our recreation,” Page told author Ashlee Vance in his page-turning book on Musk. “It’s fun for the three of us to talk about kind of crazy things, and we find stuff that eventually turns out to be real. We go through hundreds of thousands of possible things before arriving at the ones that are most promising.”

In October 2014 Page had his deputy Sundar Pichai assume day-to-day responsibilities for most of Google products. That freed up the visionary Page to ensure Google remains innovative.

Not long before that move the Information reported that Page envisioned a Google 2.0, in which his company would wrestle huge challenges such as building a model airport and city. While Google already has a plate full of moonshots, including self-driving cars, we’re now seeing the first signs of Page embracing his interest in rethinking cities.

Google announced late Wednesday that it’s launching an independent company to incubate urban technologies and improve city life. Dan Doctoroff, the former Bloomberg chief executive and deputy mayor of economic development in New York City, will lead Sidewalk Labs.

Page shared the news on his Google+ page, an indication of how personal and meaningful the effort is to him. For comparison sake, in April Google launched a mobile phone network. Project Fi is no small undertaking, but there was no personal note from Page, as is custom with most of the new products Google launches.

Page described Sidewalk Labs as 10X bet, meaning its solutions should be 10 times as good as existing city services. He mentioned housing, public transit, pollution and biking safety as areas city residents would want to see improvement in.

“As more and more people around the world live, work and settle in cities, the opportunities for improving our urban environments are endless,” Page wrote.

The University of Michigan, where Page went as an undergraduate, happens to be building a 32-acre miniature city for testing self-driving cars and more. It will open this summer.

We’ll see if Page aims for something even bigger. He’s previously said he thinks a part of the world should be set aside to test ideas without government regulation.

In an interview with Charlie Rose last spring Page spoke of wanting to encourage biking near Google’s campus. He showed a video of cyclists on wires perhaps a hundred feet above the ground.

“I was like thinking, how do you cost effectively separate the bikes from traffic. And I went and searched and this was what I found,” Page explained to Rose. “We’re not actually working on this but it gets your imagination going.”

Now Page has a canvas for his urban creativity. We can be certain whatever he produces won’t be ordinary.

The review, requested by Metro and conducted in July, highlights deep flaws in Metro’s management of its third-rail power infrastructure. Organizational charts are ambiguous, APTA says, roles and responsibilities for traction power personnel are unclear, and a formal training program exists but isn’t followed. Further, APTA says Metro is collecting data on its traction power issues but it’s unclear how the information is being used.

[Questions on cables’ safety demand day-long Metro shutdown]

Concerns about the safety of the system’s traction power system prompted a 29-hour shutdown of the system in March so Metro could inspect and replace some of its 600 jumper cables — which link gaps in the third rail — some of which were frayed and degraded enough to pose an immediate fire hazard.

Months after that emergency measure, Metro launched SafeTrack, an ambitious rebuilding program that attempts to condense three years of needed maintenance work into 10 months — though it will likely extend beyond its estimated March completion date.

[Metro releases updated SafeTrack schedule that pushes completion back at least a month]

APTA issued a series of recommendations to address lingering problems and communications gaps. The findings will be presented to the safety subcommittee of Metro’s Board of Directors at Thursday’s monthly meeting, and a final report will be issued later.

Among the findings: traction power substations were the site of debris, a fire hazard. Departments appeared to be “siloed”, causing communication lapses. And corrosion tests on the system aren’t as comprehensive as they should be.

One overarching recommendation: Metro should define clearer roles for its third-rail power personnel.

“Create positions that clearly provide ownership of specific areas: Traction Power Substation Maintainer, Electrician, Cable Maintainer and Bondsperson, etc.,” the report recommended. “Commission a manpower study to better allocate personnel.”

Reviewers also observed the Metro’s rail controllers have a high-work load that may be hard to juggle: train scheduling, traction power and fan control, management of safety procedures.

“A separate study should be conducted to determine optimum work load responsibilities,” APTA recommended.

Beyond posing a safety hazard, traction power issues have greatly diminished service on the Metrorail system over the past year.

Last September, a transformer fire destroyed a 9-megawatt power substation near Stadium-Armory, causing service disruptions that lasted for weeks. The substation was responsible for converting commercial power into third-rail current. Following the outage, Metro had to slow down trains and cap the number of trains passing through Stadium-Armory. And in May, a ball of sparks erupted after a train pulled away at Federal Center SW, prompting a shutdown of the station.

Following that incident, Metro replaced about 120 insulators, the stubby rail components propping up the third-rail, which are prone to fire when worn or damaged. It replaced an older porcelain model with a newer, supposedly more reliable fiberglass design.

APTA recommended that Metro conduct a further review of its insulators, evaluating the merits of porcelain versus composite models. Furthermore, insulators appeared to be “excessively” contaminated with soot and debris, APTA said, and Metro should find out why.

The review also suggested that Metro evaluate the design of its blow-dryer-shaped connector boots, a main factors in the L’Enfant Plaza smoke calamity last January. Chief Safety Officer Pat Lavin raised questions about the vitality of the design at a Metro board meeting in June.

Peering into the exquisitely appointed rooms in the National Building Museum exhibition “Small Stories: At Home in a Dollhouse,” one gets a glimpse at not only the highest end of children’s playthings, but also at British life over the centuries.

A lavish country mansion, a lodging house, a wartime council estate, a suburban villa and urban high-rise are all reflected in the show imported from the Victoria & Albert Museum of Childhood of London, as imagined inhabitants of each tell stories of their lives through recordings.

To those houses, the museum has added two dozen fancy and fanciful dollhouse-size rooms from commissioned U.S. artists, designers and architects, providing a view where miniatures may go.

Here’s the show by numbers.

Ilyce recently met couple who lives in Atlanta. They owned a house and also a weekend house on a lake north of the city. Then they decided to shake things up. They first decided to build a new lakehouse, so they bought land and started the process of designing a new home. They hired builders and an architect, and they wrote the first check. This all happened at the beginning of 2015. The property was supposed to be completed by the end of December.

And what’s happening now? “We finally moved into the property in May 2016,” the wife said. “Although we’re still doing some finish work.” Their former lakehouse is now on the market.

While this was going on, the couple decided to sell their primary residence and move to a townhouse that was under construction. They hired a real estate agent for their primary house and put the townhouse under contract. The builder promised he would be done by May.

Given that Atlanta, like much of the country, is an extremely hot market, their primary residence sold in two days. They set the closing date for three weeks after the new construction townhouse was to be finished.

[Modular construction is an increasingly popular way to grow a house]

It all seemed to be going well. In May, the couple sold their primary residence only to then be told by the developer that their new townhouse was months behind schedule. Nervous that the townhouse developer wasn’t being truthful about timing, the couple canceled their contract.

“We wound up in exactly the situation we didn’t want to be in,” the wife said. “We didn’t have a place in Atlanta, near our jobs, and our weekend house is a 2.5-hour commute each way.”

After looking through the limited inventory, they finally found a townhouse in the same development where they sold their single-family house.

“At least I knew I liked the neighborhood,” the wife said.

The husband moved to the weekend house, and the wife “couch-surfed” for three weeks while they waited to close on their new house.

As she was telling Ilyce this story, the wife wanted to know if there was anything she and her husband could have done differently in order to spare themselves the extra anxiety.

When you’re buying new construction, it’s possible — even likely — that the construction will be somewhat delayed or even very delayed. When we bought our last investment property, nearly nine years ago, we bought it off of the plans. The developer was more than six months delayed in turning over the property, and as a result, we lost our window to unload it before the Great Recession kicked in. That said, we were able to hold on to the property and keep it cash-neutral until the past few years, when it turned cash-positive. Rising rents in a recovering housing market helps.

[How to build the custom home you’ve always wanted]

There are two things we would have suggested the couple do differently: First, building a brand new lakehouse is enough stress. That project, the wife shared, was nearly a year behind schedule. If they didn’t need to move their in-town residence because of job considerations, the easier thing would have been to simply wait until the lakehouse was finished and the old lake house was sold.

They could have then leisurely cleaned up and cleared out their primary residence, while looking for a home to buy. Given how hot the market is for homes, we would have suggested waiting until a closing date had been set on the new property, and then putting the primary residence up for sale. The risk, of course, is that the market then changes, the new home is completed and then it takes quite some time to sell the home you could have sold in a hot market for a lot more.

Although it would have been difficult to time the buy and sale exactly, the easier thing is to always buy before selling, because then you can work on getting your new property in move-in condition or do any work you need to before you live there.

But managing two properties for sale (the lakehouse and the primary residence) along with a new construction project (the lakehouse) and a failed new construction purchase is a recipe for disaster — or at least a massive headache.

As long as interest rates stay low, families stay in their homes longer and the rate of new construction stays 30 to 50 percent below normal levels, the housing market is likely to continue to be hot. For sellers, this means you’ll have a tougher time finding a place to buy than selling your existing residence.

But remember that the housing market appeared hot in 2007 to many, and then homeowners who waited to sell couldn’t for some time or sold for at a price that was so low they were severely disappointed.

Use that to your advantage.

Set into an irregular plot at the intersection of Constitution Avenue and 14th Street NW, the museum sits on a glass base, with a three-tiered facade of canted metal panels running around all four sides. It is aligned with the regular march of museums along the north side of the Mall, but it serves as a transitional spot to the open grassy reaches that surround the Washington Monument.

Like so many things in Washington, it has been debated, refined and amended. In the process, it has become both a better and a worse building than the 2009 winning design concept presented by the team of Freelon Adjaye Bond. Its most distinctive element, the metal “corona” that gives the museum its instantly recognizable and appealing geometry, was a constant throughout the process. But it was originally meant to be a cap on a large, aboveground rectangular volume that stretched almost to the sidewalk along Constitution Avenue, space that was eventually moved underground. By removing that aboveground space — and placing the corona directly over a glass atrium with views in all four directions — the idea got simpler, stronger and more appealing.

Philip Kennicott is the Pulitzer Prize-winning Art and Architecture Critic of The Washington Post. He has been on staff at the Post since 1999, first as Classical Music Critic, then as Culture Critic.

That was a huge improvement, emphasizing the bold, upward-thrusting energy of the metal skin and diminishing the bulk of the building and its impact on the views and openness of the Washington Monument grounds. But the corona has also become darker, and under some lighting, it appears almost leaden. In early renderings it had a brassy luminosity, and looked to be made of continuous, porous, meshlike metal sheets. Now it is constructed of many smaller panels of aluminum, coated to give them a dark bronze color. That, unfortunately, was not an improvement.

Cost and construction difficulties are to blame.

“I really wanted a real bronze building, but the weight issues and maintenance became much too difficult,” says David Adjaye, the lead designer for the team that also includes the SmithGroup. Bronze is heavy and expensive, says Philip Freelon, head of the Freelon Group, the architect of record. And although the corona is the most distinctive element of the building, the “how to” for making it was a work in progress even as excavation for the project was underway.

[David Adjaye, a London-based architect, makes his mark on the District]

“In the beginning, we were not 100 percent sure how we were going to do it, to be completely honest,” Adjaye says. Unfortunately, the technical solution came with significant aesthetic compromise, a drama played out like a slow-motion train wreck in design oversight hearings before the Commission of Fine Arts.

“The Commission members emphasized that the treatment of the corona is the single most important element of the design,” wrote Thomas Luebke, secretary of the CFA, in a September 2012 letter to Smithsonian officials. “They recommended that great attention be given to determine the final detail, finish, and color of the corona panels to achieve the intended lacy and glimmering effect.”

A year later, the commission was even more worried: “Noting again the importance of the corona as the most iconic element of this new institution, the Commission members reiterated their support for the use of actual bronze in the finish of the character-defining corona panels.”

But the commissioners eventually compromised on the use of aluminum panels with a five-step “bronze” finish that doesn’t look much like bronze.

You can see what was lost in the process by studying the interior space of the glass atrium at ground level, where bright copper cladding is used to lighten the color palette. On the outside of the building, hinges affixed to doors that allow for smoke clearance in case of an emergency also have a lovely, brassy sheen. These are remnants of a bold and attractive color scheme that Adjaye says was inspired in part by the bright look of copper cookware, a fixture of Colonial-era kitchens staffed by African American slaves.

Unfortunately, although breaking the corona into smaller aluminum panels solved the weight and cost problem — and allowed the designers to recall the metalwork distinctive to African American artisans in cities such as Charleston, S.C. — it made the whole thing seem heavier. From the inside, as you look up into the interstitial space between the internal glass box of the museum and its metal facade, the support system is complex and ponderous, leaving an impression not of light and a pleasing interplay of angles and lines, but rather an encumbrance of structural clutter.

[Adjaye’s two libraries for the District expand the city’s architectural horizons]

Visitors may not notice, and once the building is open, the many ways in which it may have been better will seem far less important than all the ways in which it is reasonably good. And perhaps the rather cheap, airport-looking materials, including the ceiling panels in the atrium, will seem less obtrusive.

The building probably will be hailed as a dramatic departure from other Smithsonian museums — in part because its interior space evolved during the same design process that vitiated its exterior. When the designers moved the bulk of exhibition space below ground, they may have taken inspiration from the National September 11 Memorial Museum in New York, where the exhibition space fills a vast subterranean cavern stretching down to the bedrock below the original World Trade Center towers. That museum was designed by Davis Brody Bond, which also serves on the team that designed the African American museum.

The exhibitions covering the darkest chapters of African American history are located in a similar subterranean space, a deep underground chamber built out with ramps and platforms, and home to some of the largest and most dramatic objects in the collection, including a Pullman rail car, a plane used for training by the Tuskegee Airmen and a slave cabin.

It’s too early to say whether that space works and how it will relate to the more conventionally Smithsonian-style exhibition galleries in what Adjaye calls “the attic,” aboveground. A critical transitional space underneath a round skylight, or “oculus,” wasn’t open during the tour last week. Adjaye says that room is essential to the experience: It is a “sacred” space, offering a place for reflection and quiet as you move from studying a painful history to aboveground spaces that celebrate the accomplishments and contributions of African Americans.

[A critic takes questions on the design of the new NMAAHC]

It may seem presumptuous to complain about the impact of cost cutting when the building’s price tag is well north of $500 million, but it’s important that anyone who cares about Washington, its museums and its urban design understands how the process unfolded. By choosing a symbolically dramatic site — on the Mall, near the White House and Washington Monument — museum leaders built into the project huge and costly challenges, including a high water table, and the need to keep the visible part of the structure congruent with the buildings around it. At every turn, there became fewer ways to solve critical problems, which necessitated more compromises.

Many people are deeply invested in the success of this museum. The events of the current political season have only deepened the urgent need for incorporating African American narratives into the larger narrative of American history. Raising the $270 million in private contributions to build the museum has been an Olympian challenge from the beginning.

But if there were one building in Washington where the imperative to cut costs should have been resisted, this was it. There will be plenty to celebrate when it opens in September, but for now it’s worth acknowledging some disappointment. Yes, it has taken years to make this essential museum a reality, but let’s reiterate this fundamental truth of making civic architecture in the nation’s capital: Do it slowly, deliberately and meticulously, because it can never be undone.",A look inside the new museum of African American history shows signs of compromise.,105.2,0.8666666667,2.3333333333,high,medium,mixed,architecture

“We would sleep downstairs and go upstairs to get ready for work,” Terry Jeng says. “We often talked about getting a ‘real’ house, but it wasn’t until our daughter was born in 2008 that the house really felt too small.”

The Jengs thought about moving, but they love their neighborhood and they both work in Crystal City, an easy commute from their home. They can walk to Metro, Pentagon Row and Pentagon City and love the character of their home, which is on a large corner lot. After interviewing several contractors who told them they’d need to move out for six months and quoted them extremely high prices, they opted to expand their home with a customized but modular addition.

Modular construction, in which a complete home or an addition is built in a climate-controlled factory and then delivered to the home site, has been around since the early 1900s, when Sears and other companies offered “house kits” that were then put together by homeowners or contractors.

“Until recently, modular additions were one size fits all, but through design and manufacturing innovations they have become highly customizable,” says Michael Winn, owner of Winn Custom Modular, a division of Winn Design + Build in Falls Church. “It’s not your father’s modular. Anyone who’s picked up a copy of Dwell magazine has quickly discovered that modular construction has become very cutting edge. The modern approach is highly automated, customizable, precise, sustainable and fast.”

[How to pick the right team for your home renovation]

Winn says most of his business involves homes in Arlington and Falls Church, where the housing stock includes many World War II-era, single-story brick homes that he calls “shoeboxes.”

“A lot of our business is doing ‘pop-tops’ — adding a second story to these small homes,” Winn says.

The customization possible with today’s modular units means that each addition can blend seamlessly inside and on the exterior.

“The homes look better when we use premium finishes like cedar shake roofs and Hardiplank siding,” Winn says. “We usually put on a front porch or portico to blend the two sections together, too.”

Winn says his work with clients follows the same phases as a romantic relationship: dating, when they’re exploring the possibility of a project; getting engaged, which is the design development phase and when the homeowners arrange financing through a construction loan or a home equity loan; and marriage, when construction begins. Modular additions generally cost $200,000 to $300,000, but Winn says many of his clients opt for high-quality exterior materials and interior fixtures and finishes that can increase the cost to $400,000.

The Jengs, who added about 1,200 square feet on top of their 1,500-square-foot home, including three bedrooms, a master bath, a second bath and a laundry closet, opted for fiber-cement siding, a sun tube to add light in the hall bath, and to reconfigure the stairs from the main level to the upper level, spent about $300,000 on their addition.

“The early stages of the process are the same as in a traditional remodeling project because we have in-house architects, an interior designer, and a kitchen and bathroom designer on staff to work with the clients on plans,” Winn says. “Most people come to us either not knowing about the modular option or ambivalent about it. We can do an addition either way.”

[The owners of a Maryland kitchen-renovation firm tackle their own]

Modular additions can be designed to blend with almost any architectural style. The goal is to have a seamless transition so that the new space doesn’t look like it’s modular and doesn’t look like an addition at all. However, modular additions work best as an upper-level expansion rather than on the main level because of the difficulty in aligning the floors in a side-by-side addition, Winn says.

The modular process is also environmentally friendly since a computer is used to cut materials rather than an on-site construction worker. The Jengs both work for the Environmental Protection Agency and are interested in green building, Terry says, so a modular addition is a natural fit.

“About 20 to 30 percent of the cost of materials ends up in the dumpster at traditional sites because of waste,” Winn says.

Locally sourced materials are another tenet of green building. Winn’s modular additions are built in Liverpool, Pa., or Rocky Mountain, Va., both within the typical 500-mile radius used to define local materials.

“The raw building materials come in one end of the factory and in as little as 10 days the modular addition is produced,” Winn says. “The factory provides a controlled setting so there’s no risk of weather damage or theft of the materials.”

One big innovation in the building of modular units is that they are constructed “inside-out,” with the drywall installed before the sheathing rather than after, as it is in the field.

“There’s normally a race to get ‘dried-in’ with plywood sheathing to protect everything from the weather on a job site,” Winn says. “In the factory, the air seal can be made tighter and more ­energy-efficient.”

In order to ship the units safely and lift them by crane for installation, they are typically built with 20 percent more framing material, which makes them stronger.

Winn, who has owned his design-build firm since 2002, has been building custom modular additions for about five years.

One potential disadvantage of a modular addition is that it has some size limitations since it must fit on the back of a truck, says Winn. He says the typical modular unit adds 900 to 1,000 square feet.

“Opting for a modular addition isn’t for the faint of heart,” Winn says. “This is a case in which ‘measure twice and cut once’ is mandatory. The addition must fit, and there’s no room for making adjustments on the fly.”

Winn and his team take about one week before the unit is delivered to remove a home’s roof and prep the residence for the modular unit.

“The unit arrives and is put in place in one day with all the pre-wiring, light fixtures, plumbing and tile work in place,” he says. “It looks finished at that point from the outside, but there’s still work to be done inside to complete the customization.

Advantages of custom modular additions

Winn clients and Bethesda homeowners Vin and Kerry ­DeSomma purchased a 1950s-era home that had remained in the same family for more than 60 years and planned to expand it. The couple increased the size of their previous home with the help of a design-build firm, but this time they knew they could only build up given the size of their lot. They say they also dreaded the lengthy process of a traditional remodeling project.

“A neighbor at the local pool told us about modular units, which we had never heard of,” Vin DeSomma says. “We have three school-age kids and a dog, so the most important thing to us is that the modular addition meant we only had to move out of our home for six weeks instead of nine months. We still had the benefit of the design-build process since we could customize the modular addition, but it was much faster.”

Winn says a traditional custom addition typically takes at least four months or longer, while a custom modular addition typically less than half the time of a site-built addition. Once the design process and permitting are done, it could take as little as four to six weeks to get the addition completed. He says it’s common to have to move out for as little as two weeks.

“You don’t have to move all of your belongings, either, the way you often do with a traditional remodeling project,” he says. “The ceiling joists stay in place and the home is exposed for only a very short time.

The Jengs sectioned off a couple of rooms in their home so they could stay there through most of the renovation, which was particularly important because they have a St. Bernard and it can be hard to find temporary housing that will take a large dog.

The shorter time frame helps keep labor costs down and limits how much homeowners must spend on alternative living arrangements.

“Custom modular additions have the potential to be more affordable, but most of our clients add high-end features and finishes that add to the cost,” Winn says. “In general, modular additions cost about 10 to 15 percent less than additions that are built on-site as long as you’re comparing an apples-to-apples remodel with the same fixtures and finishes.”

The DeSommas increased the size of their home by about 30 percent, to 3,500 square feet, adding four bedrooms upstairs, each with a walk-in closet, a master bathroom, a laundry room and a hall bathroom. They turned the first-floor master bedroom into a den and knocked down a wall to create a great room. The entire project cost less than $400,000, including upgrades such as hardwood flooring, a frameless glass shower door and tile flooring in the laundry room.

“It’s interesting that most of the homeowners who are choosing modular additions are young families,” Winn says. “Older homeowners don’t have a positive impression of modular homes and think they’re low quality. Younger people, especially with growing families, understand the benefits and wonder why everyone doesn’t opt for a modular addition.”",The method offers a cheaper alternative for additions without sacrificing quality.,162.8333333333,0.5833333333,0.75,high,low,abstractive,architecture

The writer is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010.

It has been joked that the letters IMF stand for “it’s mostly fiscal” rather than International Monetary Fund. The IMF has long been a stalwart advocate of austerity as the route out of financial crisis, and it annually chastises dozens of countries for their fiscal indiscipline. Fiscal consolidation — a euphemism for cuts to government spending — is a staple of IMF rescue programs. As recently as last year, the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department was suggesting that the United States had a fiscal gap of as much as 10 percent of gross domestic product that would require massive increases in taxes and cuts in spending.

All of this makes the IMF’s recently published World Economic Outlook a remarkable and important document. In its flagship publication, the IMF advocates substantially increased public infrastructure investment, and not just in the United States but in much of the world. It further asserts that under circumstances of high unemployment, like those prevailing in much of the industrialized world, the stimulative impact will be greater if this investment is paid for by borrowing, rather than by reducing spending elsewhere or raising taxes. Most notably, the IMF asserts that properly designed infrastructure investment will reduce rather than increase government debt burdens. Stated boldly: Public infrastructure investments can pay for themselves.

Why does the IMF reach these conclusions? Consider a hypothetical investment in a new highway financed entirely with debt. Assume — counterfactually and conservatively — that the process of building the highway provides no stimulative benefit. Further assume that the investment earns only a 6 percent real return, also a very conservative assumption given widely accepted estimates of the benefits of public investment. Then, annual tax collections adjusted for inflation would increase by 1.5 percent of the amount invested, since government claims about 25 cents out of every additional dollar of income. Real interest costs — that is, interest costs less inflation — are below 1 percent in the United States and much of the industrialized world over horizons of up to 30 years. Thus, the infrastructure investment actually makes it possible to reduce burdens on future generations.

In fact, this calculation understates the positive budgetary impact of well-designed infrastructure investment, as the IMF recognized. The calculation neglects the tax revenue that comes from the stimulative benefit of putting people to work constructing new infrastructure, as well as the possible long-run benefits that come from combating recession. It neglects the reality that deferring infrastructure renewal places a burden on future generations just as surely as does government borrowing. It ignores the fact that by increasing the economy’s capacity, infrastructure investment increases the ability to handle any given level of debt. Critically, it takes no account of the fact that in many cases government can catalyze a dollar of infrastructure investment at a cost of much less than a dollar by providing a tranche of equity financing, a tax subsidy or a loan guarantee.

When it takes these factors into account, the IMF finds that a dollar of investment increases output by nearly $3. The budgetary arithmetic associated with infrastructure investment is especially attractive at a time like the present, when there are enough unused resources that greater infrastructure investment need not come at the expense of other spending. If we are entering a period of secular stagnation, unemployed resources could be available in much of the industrial world for quite some time. Even when full employment returns, there is, as the IMF shows, a strong supply-side case for infrastructure investment at a time when public capital stocks — airports, highways and the like — relative to the size of the economy have fallen by one-third or more over the last generation.

While the case for increased infrastructure investment is almost universal — possibly excepting China, where it has been used a stimulus tool for some time — the appropriate strategy for doing more differs around the world.

In the United States, the imperative is long-term budgeting for infrastructure that recognizes its benefits, as well as its costs. There is a critical need for regulatory reform to enable projects to be approved and carried forward with reasonable speed. There is also a need for recognition that government can make a critical contribution to infrastructure investment by supporting private investments in such areas as telecommunications and energy.

In Europe, the imperative is to find mechanisms for carrying out self-financing infrastructure projects outside of existing budget caps. This may be possible through the expansion of the European Investment Bank or more use of capital budget concepts in implementing fiscal reviews. For example, it is widely recognized that privatization revenue should not normally be treated as an offset to current budget deficits when it involves sacrificing a future revenue stream. But this discipline should perhaps be relaxed when revenue is invested in growth-generating projects.

In emerging markets, the need is to assure that projects are chosen in a reasonable way based on economic benefit and to reduce lags in execution.

What is crucial everywhere is the recognition that in a time of economic shortfall and inadequate public investment, there is a free lunch to be had — a way that government can strengthen the economy and its own financial position. The IMF, a bastion of “tough love” austerity, has come to this important realization. Countries with the wisdom to follow its lead will benefit.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2014/06/17/report-cites-favoritism-in-reagan-building-contract/,https://web.archive.org/web/2014061819id_/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2014/06/17/report-cites-favoritism-in-reagan-building-contract/,Report cites favoritism in Reagan Building contract,1970-01-01 00:33:34.061819,"The company operating the mammoth Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center won its contract through favoritism and was paid nearly $150,000 in fees for work primarily done by subcontractors, federal auditors said Tuesday.

Trade Center Management Associates, which manages the building owned by the General Services Administration, improperly benefited during the 2008 procurement process because a GSA official gave the firm a more positive review of its past performance than was warranted, according to the GSA Office of Inspector General audit. The company has operated the Reagan building since 1995, three years before the structure opened, and was awarded a new contract in December 2008.

The audit also faulted GSA’s Public Buildings Service for poorly overseeing the current contract, resulting in inflated costs that often benefitted Trade Center Management Associates. In one instance, auditors said, GSA lost nearly $900,000 in revenue because it failed to charge a restaurant in the Reagan building — owned by the same people who own Trade Center Management Associates — for maintaining a common area near the food court.

In another instance, the Public Buildings Service, which acts as a landlord for the civilian federal government, improperly used $25,000 in federal funds for a 2009 holiday party in the building. The service could have saved $25,000 in room rent for a training course, due to a rent waiver in its contract with Trade Center Management Associates, but instead used the waiver to fund the party, auditors said.

Ultimately, the audit concluded, the contract has contributed to financial issues at the Reagan building through “flawed oversight of the contractor’s performance, as well as increased costs, many of which should be the contractor’s responsibility.’’ It is unclear from the 29-page document how serious the financial issues are.

In a statement, Trade Center Management Associates said the company had not been sent a copy of the report, “although we have just learned it can now be found online. We will take the time to thoroughly review the report.’’

“We are fully committed to making sure the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center remains one of the hallmark venues in our nation’s capital,’’ the company added.

Jackeline Stewart, a GSA spokeswoman, said the agency has taken steps to address the report’s recommendations, including the development of a new procurement model for its Public Buildings Service that “maximizes financial oversight and enhances contractor transparency for the Ronald Reagan Building and the International Trade Center.’’

“GSA is committed to delivering the best value to our federal partners and the American taxpayer,’’ she added. “The agency will continue to work closely with the Inspector General to further ensure the integrity of the procurement process.’’

The 3.1-million-square foot Reagan building, the district’s largest structure, is dedicated to the advancement of trade and includes a conference and event center, office space and retail and dining establishments. Formerly a dusty parking lot, it opened to great fanfare, culminating three decades of work to restore Pennsylvania Avenue, launched by President John F. Kennedy’s reaction to the street’s aged, dingy storefronts during his inaugural ride from the Capitol to the White House in 1961.

The favoritism that auditors said has benefitted Trade Center Management Associates began with the selection process, when a GSA official completed a past performance questionnaire, and “incorrectly stated that revenue under the prior contract exceeded expenses,’’ the report said.

The flawed oversight, the auditors said, resulted in the company being paid $147,730 for general and administrative expenses and profit on work primarily done by subcontractors. “As the prime contractor, TCMA performed minimal work on these additional contracts and did not significantly contribute to their performance,’’ the report said.

Going forward, we’ll post updates to this story.

In total, 11 people were shot Friday near the Empire State Building. Earlier reports pegged that figure at 2 killed, 8 wounded.

The New York Times also reports that Jeffery Johnson was 58, not 53 as previously reported.

Governor Andrew Cuomo released a statement about the shooting:

Today’s shooting near the Empire State Building is a tragedy for New York City and our entire state. My administration, including members of the State Police, is actively monitoring the situation and working closely with city law enforcement agencies to ensure that the safety of New Yorkers and those visiting New York City comes first. I commend members of the New York Police Department, as well as the first responders and civilians, who acted bravely and took swift action to save the lives of others and prevent this tragedy from becoming much worse. Our state has no tolerance for senseless acts of violence that harm our people, and we will do everything possible to ensure that law enforcement officials have the tools they need so residents of the city and tourists can enjoy everything New York City has to offer without fearing for their own safety and security. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I send my condolences to the friends and family of the innocent victim who died in this attack, and wish those who were injured in today’s shooting a speedy recovery.

Today’s shooting happened outside the Empire State Building, but in 1997, there was a shooting on the observation deck of the New York City landmark. The gunman in that shooting, 69-year-old Ali Abu Kamal, killed one tourist and injured six others after losing his savings.

From the New York Daily News:

“Once a respected and stern English instructor who favored business suits, Kamal lived in an upper-middle class section of Gaza City and had built up a nest egg family members said was between $70,000 and $300,000. But Kamal lost the money in America through a series of bad investments and as his life spiralled out of control as the chain-smoking teacher blew the last of his dough on liquor and hookers.”

Mayor Bloomberg identified the assailant in Friday’s Empire State Building shooting as Jeffrey Johnson and said that Johnson’s victim was a former colleague from Hazan Import Corp., on West 33rd Street near Fifth Avenue, where he once worked.

A quick internet search yields a memo that Johnson wrote on Hazan’s behalf in 2010. He was looking to buy cardboard hang tags for the company.

Hazan Import Corp needs to print a minimum of 3000 (three thousand) Sample Hangtags which have a quarter inch diameter eyelet (grommet some call it) for attachment with swift ties….

Thank you, Jeff Johnson — Hazan Import.

New York City Police identified the suspect in the morning shooting near the Empire State Building as Jeffery Johnson, 53, of Manhattan. One victim, 41, name withheld pending notification of relatives, died at the scene.

At a late morning news conference with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Johnson had been laid off as a women’s clothing designer last year and that his target was the 41-year-old former co-worker at Hazan Import Corp. Kelly said Johnson shot the man in the head with a .45-caliber handgun outside the Hazan offices on West 33rd Street near Fifth Avenue.

According to Kelly, a construction worker who saw Johnson running away alerted two counterterrorism police officers near the Empire State Building on Fifth Avenue. When the officers approached Johnson near the Fifth Avenue entrance of the building, he pulled a gun from a bag and began shooting at them, Kelly said. He said the officers returned fire, killing Johnson.

Bloomberg said two women and seven men were shot during the gunfire and that the nine people wounded were at city hospitals and would survive their injuries.

Bloomberg said Johnson had worked at Hazan as a designer of women’s accessories and had been laid off a year earlier when the company downsized. He said Johnson did not appear to have a criminal record and that “we don’t know much about him.” He said police believed Johnson used only one gun.

“It’s a terrible thing, our first thoughts are for the murder victim,” Bloomberg said, as he closed the news conference. “There’s an awful lot of guns out there”

The Guardian’s Adam Gabbatt interviewed a woman who saw an injured man fall to the ground after the shooting. Listen to her account. She says it happened at 9:04 a.m. ET.

Two law enforcement officials in New York City say a recently fired store worker shot a former colleague to death and then randomly opened fired on others near the Empire State Building.

The officials say eight other people were struck by bullets but those injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

Photographer Muhammad Malik posted a graphic picture of an injured man on Instagram. As of 10:45 a.m., there were 40 comments on the photo and at least five of those are from major news organizations like Reuters, the Globe and Mail, The Guardian U.S., The Associated Press, and ABCNews.com, requesting permission to use the photo.

News futurist Jeff Jarvis pointed out the requests and also sent tweets illustrating how social media is influencing and very much driving the coverage of this story.

Citing a law enforcement official, the AP reports that the shooting stemmed from a workplace dispute.

The Empire State Building opens for visitors at 8a.m. on weekdays. According to the building’s Web site, four million people visit each year; 10,000 people work there and about 10,000 people visit each day.

Mickey Marrero, a New York-based photograph, is posting pictures from the shooting on his Flickr account. WARNING: PHOTOS ARE GRAPHIC

According to several news reports, two people, including the alleged shooter, have died. The body of the alleged shooter is still lying at the crime scene and can be seen on live video from helicopters over the scene. At least eight other people have been wounded, a city official told the New York Times.

The 103-floor Empire State Building, one of New York City’s most famous tourist attractions, draws more than 10,000 visitors each day. According to the building’s Web site, about 20,000 people work in the building, which opens for visitors at 8 a.m. daily.

The Empire State Building is about two blocks from major transit hub Pennsylvania Station.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is a well-known proponent of stricter gun laws. In the wake of a high-profile shooting like this, New Yorkers can expect a tough response from the Mayor’s office.

After the theater shooting in Colorado, Bloomberg challenged both President Obama and Mitt Romney to say how they would address gun violence.

“You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be President of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country.”

So far the Mayor’s Twitter account is silent about the shooting.

In the past, the NYPD has dispatched agents to gun shows across the country to document illegal gun sales.

A Reddit thread about the shooting already includes first-hand accounts of the incident. Reddit user Titan413 says they were there when it happened. Read the developing thread:

I was on the bus right there when it happened. At least four people got shot. Two on the northwest side of the street, one empire state building ticket guy in the middle of the crosswalk, and someone on the southwest corner. That was terrifying.

Another user, CatfishRadiator, says that they saw the aftermath:

There is a man with a bullet in his head in front of my building at 10w 33rd. His blood had just reached the gutters when I arrived.

19 people were shot in Chicago last night, prompting some on Twitter to point out the lack of media attention (as compared to the ESB shooting) and prompting others to comment on gun violence in general.

Get down!’” said Marc Engel, an accountant who was on a bus in the area when he heard the shots. “It took about 15 seconds, a lot of pop, pop, pop, pop, one shot after the other.”

Afterward, he saw the sidewalks littered with the wounded, including one person “dripping enough blood to leave a stream.”

Wearing an olive suit and tie and carrying a briefcase, Jeffrey Johnson walked up to the import company vice president, Steven Ercolino, put a gun to his head and fired without saying a word, authorities said. A witness told investigators that Johnson shot Ercolino once in the head and, after he fell to the sidewalk, stood over him and shot him four more times.

“Jeffrey just came from behind two cars, pulled out his gun, put it up to Steve’s head and shot him,” said Carol Timan, whose daughter, Irene, was walking to Hazan Imports at the time with Ercolino.

The gunman walked away and calmly turned up 5th Avenue, where he blended in with the crowd, police said.

A construction worker who saw the shooting followed Johnson and alerted two police officers, a detail regularly assigned to patrol city landmarks like the 1,454-foot skyscraper since the 9/11 terror attacks, officials said.

There were conflicting accounts about whether Johnson fired at the police officers or just pointed the gun at them.

Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly initially said the officers were fired upon, but later said police were investigating. Johnson can be seen on video reaching into a bag, pulling out a .45-caliber pistol and pointing it at officers, Kelly said.

The two officers drew their weapons and fired 16 rounds, killing Johnson, Kelly said.

“These officers ... had absolutely no choice,” Kelly said. “This individual took a gun out very close to them and perhaps fired at them.”

Kelly said investigators believe police may be responsible for some of the injuries, based on the gunman’s weapon. Johnson’s semi-automatic weapon was equipped to fire at least eight rounds; at least one round was left in the clip, police said. Another loaded magazine was in his briefcase.

Johnson legally bought the gun in Sarasota, Fla., in 1991, but he didn’t have a required permit to possess the weapon in New York City, police said.

“New York City, as you know, is the safest big city in the country, and we are on pace to have a record low number of murders this year,” Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. “But we are not immune to the national problem of gun violence,” he said about the shooting, which comes in the wake of mass shootings inside a Colorado movie theater and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.",Fire officials say several people have been shot outside the Empire State Building.,39.3571428571,0.5,0.5,high,low,abstractive,architecture

But only six years after author Martin Moeller published the last version in 2006, he is back with the latest, the fifth.

The Newseum, included in the AIA’s new guide. (James P. Blair - NEWSEUM) “The different time periods says a lot of about the city,” says Moeller, who wrote the book independently from his day job as senior vice president and curator of the National Building Museum. “Washington has changed tremendously in the last few years, it is really phenomenal.”

That meant substantially revising the old volume, a cherished local handbook to the architectural history of the District. There are almost 50 new entries, and a new focus on neighborhoods such as Logan Circle/Shaw and Capitol South where growth has been particularly dynamic. Moeller, who has authored the last two iterations of the volume, sees Washington architecture resurgent, after a period of low energy in the 80s and 90s.

“I’d say the city is much more self-secure,” in its identity, he says. “Despite the stereotypes, it has actually been a leader culturally and in architectural terms.”

Unlike some other AIA guides, Moeller’s book brings a critic’s perspective to the built environment, and while one might disagree here and there with his observations, he is a very judicious and reliable observer. Among the new entries is this take on the 2008 Newseum, designed by Polshek Partnership Architects: “Like the news itself these days, the Newseum comes at you as a barrage, with numerous elements vying for your attention.” The author finds the front of this building includes “a veritable catalog of curtain walls, each attractive in its own right, but with no apparent reason for the multiplicity of patterns and glass treatments.” Exactly so.

“I tried to be humorous or light about it,” he says. “I didn’t want to do anything that was over the top.” The book is a mix of personal observation, history and lot of noticing details in a way that will prompt readers to look more keenly at the buildings around them.

Moeller’s goal is to draw out “something that people could see but might not understand or appreciate, a detail, or a use of material that is innovative. At the same time I tried to think of some things that might be interesting about the building, but not tangible. A case that comes to mind: The fact that the Watergate complex was largely designed by Benito Mussolini’s architect. It is funny in a weird way, you don’t think of that connection and it opens up a variety of other questions about the relation of architectural history to political history. It gives people a little bit of depth and context.”

The AIA guide is all that, and it fits nicely in the glove compartment, or a backpack.

As online ordering of everything from last-minute meals to unwieldy children’s bicycles becomes the norm, luxury condo buildings are developing strategies to keep up with the deliveries—and bring a white glove experience to residents who are getting more boxes than ever. This year, the U.S. Postal Service expects to deliver 15.5 billion pieces of holiday mail, a 10.5% increase from 2014, according to agency estimates.

To combat the tidal wave—one large apartment operator recently stopped accepting parcels at all of its properties—luxury building managers are implementing electronically coded lockers, installing hidden storage areas and adding bellhops. Residents living in luxury high-rises in cities like New York, Miami and Los Angeles—who are paying hefty monthly maintenance fees—expect package retrieval and drop off to be a seamless amenity, say building managers.

“The tricky part is [handling packages] after Thanksgiving,” says Arber Bruncaj, resident manager at Greenthal Management, which runs 388 Bridge Street, a 378-unit building in Brooklyn. On weekdays leading up to Christmas, the building sees up to 250 packages a day rather than the typical 100, he estimates.

The building earlier this year hired an additional employee to serve as a “hallman,” who brings packages upstairs to hand to residents as soon as they arrive, he says. If residents aren't home, they have the option of allowing the hallman to drop off the package inside the apartment’s entryway, or even place perishable items inside the fridge, he adds.

In prior years, the Peachtree Place Condominiums in Atlanta’s Buckhead neighborhood would hire someone to receive and distribute packages during the winter months, says Dot Edwards, association manager at Access Management Group, which runs the development. Residents, often anxious about their gifts arriving on time, would wander to the front to ask about deliveries.

This past summer, the 330-unit development joined forces with startup Luxer One, which installed 40 package lockers near the lobby. Now residents can retrieve packages from the lockers via a one-time access code they receive via email or text. Once a package is picked up, the locker is reset and can be used for another delivery. The 40-unit system costs about $20,000 and the service costs $129 a month, according to Luxer.

At the Century, a 140-unit building in Los Angeles, owners receive an online alert that a package has arrived. Building staff flip a switch which turns on a light in a resident’s laundry area, says Related Companies’ Stacy Gerowitz, who manages the building. Residents retrieve their package from a locked “concierge closet” and flip the switch outside of the closet to indicate that they’ve retrieved the item.

Finding room for all the boxes can be particularly challenging in an older building. Before the 1960s, someone was home all day to handle deliveries, so storage near the lobby was minimal, says Marilyn Sygrove, an interior designer who works with buildings in New York. In the past few years, Ms. Sygrove says she has worked with more than a half dozen prewar buildings looking to add package storage areas.

To avoid carving out rooms that could ruin elaborate ceiling designs, Ms. Sysgrove commissions pieces like floor-to-ceiling armoires for $8,000 to $20,000. Many of the pieces are “as big as we can make it,” she says.

Not only do buildings have to alert residents to an arrival, they also have to know when to keep certain residents in the dark. Scott Cohen, a doorman at 850 Park Avenue, a prewar co-op on New York’s Upper East Side, says a common request is to store presents out of sight of prying children. “We keep [the box] downstairs in the package room and the night before Christmas, they will bring it upstairs,” he says.

In Brooklyn, the front desk was left scrambling when a husband recently asked to skip an online notification for a package for his wife, says Mr. Bruncaj. Rather than enter a package into the building’s tracking system, the doormen passed confidential shift notes for 48 hours to keep the package from being traceable.

Buildings also have to ensure they get the right package to the right recipient. Brianne Manz, who runs parenting website Stroller in the City from her New York apartment and often receives products to test, says she recently opened a package meant for a neighbor that was delivered to her door.

Rather than telling her neighbor about the box—which was sent by a sex shop—she quietly placed it near his entrance after he left for work. “I just left it at his door this morning,” she says.","Luxury buildings in New York, Atlanta and Los Angeles prepare for the wave of holiday deliveries with electronic lockers and custom armoires",40.1304347826,0.8695652174,1.8260869565000002,high,medium,mixed,architecture

Total construction spending climbed 0.7% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.083 trillion, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, the highest level since May 2008.

Private building led the way, with both residential and nonresidential constructionÂ hitting new postrecession highs. State and local government spending dropped in July, but only after posting solid gains duringÂ the previous four months.

“The overall impression from the past few months is that the construction sector overall is the strongest part of the economy, with spending up at a remarkable 26% annualized rate in the three months to July,”Â Ian Shepherdson, chief economist atÂ Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.

To be sure, construction spending data is volatile and often heavily revised. Low oil prices, meanwhile, may hinder investment in structures used to extract natural resources from the ground. But the overall construction trend has been building through the course of the year and the most recent updates were broadly positive for second-quarter growth. And actual spending during the first seven months of the year was up 9.3% from the same period in 2014.

The latest construction dataÂ stand in contrast August manufacturing figures out on Tuesday, which showed that sector expanding but at a slower pace. Other components of the economy have been broadly positive, with second-quarter growth revised to show a healthy reboundÂ and early readings for the third quarter suggesting a degree of momentum.

Morgan Stanley revised its second-quarter gross domestic product growthÂ estimateÂ to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.8% from 3.7% after Tuesday’s construction data.Â The bank is forecasting growth at a 2.2% pace in the third quarter.

While the U.S. economy appears to be holding its own, growth in China and elsewhere appears to be on shakier ground.Â U.S. stocks fell earlyÂ Tuesday following weak manufacturing data fromÂ the world’s second-largest economy.

U.S. construction spending rose to the highest level in more than seven years in July. A previous version of this article incorrectly said June.

QCOM -1.46 % said on Wednesday that it would consider changes to its corporate structure and cut $1.4 billion in spending, moving to appease investors amid problems that triggered a 47% drop in its fiscal third-quarter profit.

The company said the review, which it expects to complete by the end of the year, would include possibilities such as separating its businesses.

The San Diego-based communications chip designer and licensing company, which promised in April to review its cost structure, said it also would cut 15% of its full-time staff and “significantly” reduce its temporary workforce. It also plans to cut $300 million in annual share-based compensation grants.

Qualcomm estimated that it would book between $350 million and $450 million in restructuring charges related to the moves. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Qualcomm was considering such a review.

Qualcomm has studied a breakup before and rejected the idea, but the possibility re-emerged after activist investor Jana Partners LLC in April bought a major stake in the company.

Qualcomm said it also has reached an agreement with Jana to add Mark McLaughlin, chief executive of Palo Alto Network, and Tony Vinciquerra, a senior adviser to hedge fund TPG, to its board. Qualcomm said it would add a third director approved by Jana to its board.

Shares of Qualcomm, down 21% over the past year, slipped 0.5% to $63.92 in after-hours trading.

Qualcomm disclosed the moves Wednesday along with results for the quarter ended June 28, which brought more signs of how its business has suffered amid shifting fortunes of major smartphones makers and growing competition. Revenue declined 14% over the prior year.

The company also issued a forecast for the current quarter that pointed to further weak conditions and again lowered its forecast for the year.

Qualcomm is the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones. Its products handle cellular communications and computing in smartphones, sometimes on separate chips or combined on a single piece of silicon.

The company has experienced a turbulent year, paying $975 million to settle an antitrust suit in China, while authorities in the U.S., Europe and South Korea launched new investigations. Meanwhile, rivals such as MediaTek Inc. 2454 -1.82 % have begun to sell new modem chips that have cut into Qualcomm’s dominant share in technology for handling fourth-generation LTE networks.

Another factor lately concerns longtime customer Samsung Electronics Co. SSNHZ 0.00 % The South Korean company has been losing market share in smartphones to Apple Inc., AAPL -4.23 % which tends to use Qualcomm modem chips but not the more expensive processors that Samsung has frequently used.

This spring, Samsung raised another issue by opting to use its own chips in the flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone.

For its fiscal third quarter ended in June, Qualcomm reported net income of $1.18 billion, or 73 cents a share, down from a profit of $2.24 billion, or $1.31 a share a year earlier. Revenue declined to $5.83 billion from $6.81 billion a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis that excludes share-based compensation and results from an investment unit, Qualcomm said per-share profit was 99 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected earnings of 95 cents a share on revenue of $5.85 billion.

For the current quarter, Qualcomm projected that adjusted earnings will fall by up to 40% to 75 cents to 95 cents share, while forecasting revenue of $4.7 billion to $5.7 billion, which would be a decline of up to 30% over the prior-year period.

The company also cut its forecast for the year ending in September. Qualcomm now expects per-share earnings of $4.50 a share to $4.70 a share, down from its lowered forecast of $4.60 to $5 a share in April. It is now calling for revenue of $24.5 billion to $25.5 billion, down from its April forecast of $25 billion to $27 billion in revenue.

These include a rural studio for artist Peter Halley; the future Women’s Building, an ex-prison in Manhattan her team is transforming into a center for women’s support organizations; and the 21c Museum Hotels, a boutique chain whose new Oklahoma City location opened last month in a former Ford Motors F -0.15 % plant. “It’s the same reason I prefer smaller, grittier cities to trophy cities like London or Paris,” said Ms. Berke of her predilection for the raw. “I love seeing the exquisiteness of the not-consciously-designed thing.”

She may not go in much for trophies, but Ms. Berke recently landed a big one: On July 1, she succeeded Robert A.M. Stern as the dean of the Yale School of Architecture, becoming the first female to hold the post. The date coincided with the publication of her third book, “House Rules: An Architect’s Guide To Modern Life” (Rizzoli). In a recent sit-down, the Upper East side resident—whose almost-6-foot stature and Sontagian locks make her easy to spot as she strides around New York City—discussed her ardor for plywood, a vegetable-themed parlor game she’s itching to try and the scourge of overscale furniture.

As a child I was obsessed with: painting on the walls of my parents’ house in Queens. I made murals of vines and flowers, highly patterned. I think I got it out of my system.

I dream of designing: a house of worship, because the idea of a space that’s about silence and reflection is just so appealing. I think of Bernard Maybeck’s First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Berkeley, Calif., or a Quaker meetinghouse. Just the simplest possible quiet volume.

One of my favorite design moves is: breaking down the barriers between indoors and outdoors. I love screened porches, floor to ceiling windows and stone flooring that can extend from the inside out. The Japanese notion of the borrowed view is important to me, because I believe that a site often extends beyond a property line.

The home improvement that’s most worth making is: effective lighting you can really control. Lighting is mood and warmth and happiness. You want task lighting for work and then something more restful, serene or romantic.

My design pet peeve is: over-scaled furniture. I like pieces sized to the body—that support and comfort you. People often try to fill a loft or double-height room with large furniture. I prefer to celebrate the vastness of such spaces.

My go-to seating is: Eero Saarinen’s Womb chair—so comfortable. I have one with the original orange upholstery.

My favorite underdog material is: plywood. Also basic white ceramic tile, 4 inches square.

I detest the color: pink. I look at it and have no immediate response.

The strangest request I’ve gotten from a client is: inappropriate for a family newspaper, but it involves a secret room. Clients’ personal quirks were behind other requests: for beach-house windows that open facing a foghorn; for bedroom floors that feel just so underfoot.

The biggest disrupter in my life is: dogs. Since marrying and having a family, I’ve always had a Weimaraner or two. Today we have two rescues, Percy and Blue. I designed William Wegman’s loft a million years ago, and that’s how we got turned onto the breed. They’re big, they’re silly, they’re playful—they bring enormous mess and enormous joy to our lives.

My favorite design innovation for dogs is: those little rubber booties that protect a dog’s feet from getting burned with street salt in the winter. Otherwise, I like a simple dog bed lined in fabric that matches the color of the carpet or the walls. You want it to be in the background.

Indispensable in my kitchen is: a cheese grater. We have two or three. I find grating Parmesan very satisfying.

The most interesting food, from an architectural standpoint, is: the artichoke. If you got a group of architects together for dinner and served artichokes, you’d have the most revealing evening imaginable. Everyone would have a different method of stacking leaves on the perimeter of the plate. And it might even get competitive—I can only fantasize about it.

Everyone should know more about the architect: Lina Bo Bardi. She’s gotten some attention lately, but in terms of a broad public knowledge of her work, she’s way underappreciated. Her materiality, color sense, understanding of climate and her spunk—to make a career as an Italian woman in midcentury Brazil—all amazing.

The architecture book I always come back to is: The AIA guide to New York, because I walk the city every day and then look up the buildings I’ve seen. I’m waiting for someone to do a guidebook for all the buildings that don’t have famous architects.

I dress for comfort, but I just can’t quit: statement earrings by Haroldo Burle Marx, the Brazilian designer whose brother, Roberto, was a landscape designer and artist. I’ve got several pairs.

People underestimate the value of: the unexpected material in an unexpected location. Like an old-school blackboard on your kitchen wall for your kids to draw on.

The shade of white I like most is: impossible to name. You have to choose white based on what the sunlight is bouncing off outside, which way the room faces, what the floor color is. But there are a million whites and they’re all great.

My interior-design hero is: Alexander Girard. As a child, my parents took me to La Fonda del Sol, his iconic and unfortunately demolished restaurant in Manhattan. The energy, the colors—every space, surface and object was designed to create a total environment that was just great fun. As an adult, I encountered Girard again at the Miller House in Columbus, Ind., which he designed with Saarinen. Unlike the Glass House or the Farnsworth House, which are elegant and very austere, it is more like a modernist family villa. It’s grand but comfortable, with tremendous personality, and it was very attuned to how the Millers lived.

An example of repetition elevating the ordinary is: Rows of jars of deep red tomato sauce that look beautiful in the light. My sister-in-law is a wonderful gardener, and she’s rightfully proud of the tomatoes she grows. My brother is a great cook, and he makes tomato sauce and stores it in Mason jars to use throughout the year. So they keep them out on display, which is a way of celebrating family and food as a part of everyday life.

The quickest way to give a house curb appeal is to: paint the front door. I love a bright red door, in Benjamin Moore’s Chili Pepper red. It’s cheerful and welcoming. I’m also partial to dark, dark green, almost black, in a high gloss. It’s traditional in New England and very beautiful.

According to Mordy Lipkis, whose family has owned the Tribeca building since 1968, plans are in place to convert the 52-foot-wide building into a home, which is listing with Leonard Steinberg of Compass. If buyers prefer to do the build-out themselves, the building can be purchased as raw space for $50 million, he said. Converting the building, which has a landmark limestone facade, would take 18 to 24 months, Mr. Steinberg said.

Mr. Lipkis said the Franklin Street building, built in the mid-1800s, was originally used for industrial purposes. His family converted it to apartments, and it has housed a number of artists over the years. “We’ve had a collection of very creative types,” said Mr. Lipkis, whose family owns a number of properties in the area.

But with residential values in Tribeca “skyrocketing,” he said, it makes sense for the family to sell. “The economics are pushing us in that direction.”

Mr. Steinberg said plans call for the house, shown here converted in a rendering, to measure about 20,000 square feet, with seven bedrooms, a pool, a gym, an elevator and a roof deck. A buyer could use those plans, request changes or start from scratch, Mr. Lipkis said.

The building has one residential and one retail tenant, both of which will be vacating soon, Mr. Lipkis said. “It’s very rare to have a building that can be delivered completely vacant,” he added. For a buyer, it is “a blank slate where they can do anything they want.”",The owners of a Tribeca apartment building are offering to convert it into a single-family home and deliver it finished to a buyer,13.52,1.0,7.32,low,high,mixed,architecture

The person who was hurt sustained non-life threatening injuries, the FDNY said. The building, at 642 W. 57th St., was behind scaffolding and was in the process of being razed. City records indicated that demolition was to start Dec. 15.

Helen Rosenthal, a New York City Council member who represents the neighborhood, said that as crews worked to take down the building, it partially collapsed between the second and third floors, causing scaffolding near the street to fall.

A bus driver was asleep on an empty school bus parked underneath the scaffolding but escaped unhurt.

“I heard boom, boom, boom!” said Daniel Campbell, the 45-year-old driver from Paterson, N.J.

“It was like a nightmare,” he said. “Wood, everything was coming down, bricks.”

“When I woke up, everything was falling.”

He said the bus’s windshield was smashed by the debris and several windows were also damaged. He said he exited the rear of the bus to get out.

He said he drove an elementary school class from Ridgewood, N.J., to a field trip in Manhattan prior to the accident. He said the students were eating at Hard Rock Cafe when the accident occurred.

As the energy sector boomed in recent years, developers flocked to Houston, so much so that one-sixth of all the office space under construction in the entire U.S. is in the metropolitan area of the Texas city.

But now, the need for more offices is drying up, thanks to a drop in oil prices that has spun energy companies from an outlook of optimism and growth to anxiety and cutbacks. Oil prices have fallen by more than 50% since June.

Demand for office space is “going to basically stop,” said Walter Page, director of office research at property data firm CoStar Group Inc. “It hurts a lot more when you have a lot of construction.”

By the end of 2014, construction had started on about 80 buildings with about 18 million square feet of office space in the greater Houston area, according to CoStar. Many of the buildings were planned or started when oil was above $100 a barrel. On Tuesday, oil futures traded around $50. The amount under construction is equal to Kansas City, Mo.’s entire downtown office market and is 16% of all U.S. office development under way.

The rush of building has created thousands of jobs—not only at building sites, but also at window manufacturers, concrete companies and restaurants that feed the workers.

But just as the wave of office-space supply approaches, energy companies, including Halliburton Co. , Baker Hughes Inc., Weatherford International and BP PLC, have collectively announced that more than 23,000 jobs would be cut, with many of them expected to be in Houston.

Fewer workers, of course, means less need for office space. Employers have rushed to sublease space in recent months, with 5.2 million square feet of space on the market as of last month, up about 1 million square feet from mid-2014, according to brokerage firm Savills Studley. BP, for example, is trying to sublet 240,000 square feet of space at its campus in the Westlake neighborhood, which represents about 11% of BP’s space at the campus, according to CoStar. A BP spokesman said the company is “consolidating” its footprint.

Conditions could improve if oil prices rise. The International Energy Agency on Tuesday said oil companies’ recent cutbacks in production will likely slow the growth of U.S. oil output, which in turn would lead to a rebound in prices.

But the current building boom is Houston’s biggest since the 1980s, when an oil bust, coupled with a rash of empty skyscrapers, made Houston a national symbol of overbuilding. Then, armed with debt from a banking sector eager to lend, developers brought a tidal wave of building to Houston, in some years increasing the office stock by well over 10%. Vacancy rates shot up past 30% from single digits, property values plummeted and landlords defaulted on mortgages.

That contributed to a wave of failures for banks stuffed with commercial-property loans. More than 425 Texas institutions between 1980 and 1989 failed, including nine of the state’s 10 largest banks.

Few are predicting a shock near that scale this time. Even if oil prices stay low, the local economy is more diversified than in the 1980s with sectors such as health care and higher education comprising a larger share of the workforce. In addition, new construction represents about 6.3% all the area’s total office stock, and there is far less speculative construction done before a tenant is signed up.

“Everybody here in Houston is waiting to exhale,” said Michael Scheurich, chief executive of general contractor Arch-Con Corp., which currently is building two midsize office projects in the area. Mr. Scheurich said his company has grown to about 80 employees from fewer than 25 in 2011 amid the construction boom. Now he is hoping the local economy will have “a soft landing.”

Still, cranes abound throughout Houston, thanks to publicly traded real-estate companies, pension funds and other interests like Swedish construction giant Skanska AB, which are funding construction without as much reliance on debt as in the 1980s.

Development firm Hines is building a 48-story tower in downtown Houston “on spec,” or speculatively without a tenant lined up. In the Woodlands, a growing region north of the city, Exxon Mobil is building a three-million square foot headquarters that is scheduled to replace its current home downtown.

Running west from the downtown along Interstate 10, numerous midsize construction projects aimed at the “upstream” companies focused on energy extraction are being built in the so-called Energy Corridor.

Analysts say this shows how the sector is highly susceptible to booms and busts because of the long lag time between when buildings are started and when they are delivered, compounded by the tendency of developers and financiers to start projects en masse, late in cycles.

Developers are often victims of “herding and groupthink,” said Rachel Weber, an urban planning professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who is writing a book about office overdevelopment in Chicago. “There is a sense that if everybody is moving in the same direction and acting the same way, that you do better to mimic that kind of behavior.”

Many of those building are bracing for a sting in the short-term. It could be even more painful if oil prices stay low.

It “is going to be a soft year—it’s hard not to see that,” said Mike Mair, an executive vice president in charge of Houston-area development for Skanska. The company is putting the finishing touches on a new 12-story tower in the Energy Corridor that is 62% leased. Construction is under way on a nearly identical building next door for which it doesn’t have any tenants.

Still, Mr. Mair said he believes in the city’s economic strength in the mid- and long-term, giving him confidence to finish work on the second tower. “I’m not afraid of ’16 and ’17,” he said.

Of course, higher vacancy rates would mean lower rents, which is good for anyone signing a lease. Rents at top-quality buildings averaged $34.51 a square foot at the end of 2014, up about 15% from early 2012, according to CoStar. But brokers say landlord incentives have grown, and rents typically follow the direction of oil prices, with a lag of one or two quarters. Still, the rents are a bargain compared with other major cities such as New York, where top-quality offices rent for an average $59 a square foot.

The city of Houston, for one, could be a beneficiary of lower rents. The government had been planning to build a new police department headquarters at an estimated cost of between $750 million and $1 billion.

Late last month, the mayor’s office said it was examining the possibility of leasing the building that Exxon Mobil is leaving, which would cost far less than the city’s original plan.

Pruitt

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.s original headquarters at the corner of Wall and Broad streets in New York might have a future as a department store if the buildings owner is successful in marketing it for retail uses.

Chinese investor China Sonangol, which bought the vacant, 180,000-square-foot building last year, hired brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc. last month to solicit retail tenants for the four-story building. Brokers Joanne Podell and Matthew Seigel reasoned that, with much of the buildings interior gutted, it could appeal to single users such as Macys Inc.s Bloomingdales or other full-price department stores.

Theres a real need for such a store downtown, Ms. Podell said. You have a huge number of residents, office workers and tourists. Downtown is underserviced.

The building, located at 23 Wall Street, has the substantial frontage on both Wall and Broad streets that a retailer would covet. It sits across Broad Street from the New York Stock Exchange and across Wall Street from the Federal Hall National Memorial.

Built in 1914, the building housed the original J.P. Morgan & Co. for decades and became known as the House of Morgan. It has been vacant for several years.

One firefighter told ninemsn that the blaze had started in the basement of the disused Ausgrid substation, and was initially difficult to locate, because there was smoke detected on the upper floors.

The officer said two crews had been sent inside, with one searching high and the other low; apparently the smoke had risen through an elevator shaft.

The substation will soon be demolished.

There is no indication at this stage that anyone was inside, and just how the fire started remains unclear.

The building has been approved for demolition to make way for a new complex that will include a substation and office space.

Surveillance footage shows the white SUV run a set of lights before clipping a fire hydrant and slamming into the building in Kansas City, Missouri shortly after 10am local time.

Then, one corner of the structure collapses, burying the SUV in a pile of bricks.

In a photo shared by local newspaper the Kansas City Star, an antique vehicle that was being stored in the building can be seen perched on top.

""She didn’t stop driving like crazy,"" Kansas City police chief Chris Sicoli said.

""Luckily, the building has been vacant,"" Mr Sicoli said.

Police had been pursuing the vehicle, which had been reported stolen, at the time of the incident.

The female driver suffered non-life threatening injuries in the crash and was taken to hospital for treatment.

The building's owner, Chris Willsey, said he kept about a dozen unrestored vehicles from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s inside the two-story structure.

Mr Willsey said he hoped that the structure, which dated to the 1920s and once served as a Ford dealership, could be preserved.

Norse paganism fell by the wayside in Iceland when Christianity swept through some 1,000 years ago. Now a modern movement—which views gods as metaphors with lessons to impart, reports the Guardian—is erecting the first temple to Norse gods since the age of the Vikings.

""I don’t believe anyone believes in a one-eyed man who is riding about on a horse with eight feet,"" says the high priest of the Asatru Association.

""We see the stories as poetic metaphors and a manifestation of the forces of nature and human psychology."" The half-buried temple will be aligned with the sun's path, incorporate the ""golden ratio,"" and contain the numbers 9 and 432,000, which are sacred to many pagan followers, reports the BBC.

Work is scheduled to begin in March in a popular woodland area overlooking Iceland's capital city Reykjavik, which donated the site. The association, whose membership has tripled in recent years to 2,400 (in a country of 326,000), is footing the $975,000 construction bill.

It's expected to be finished in the summer of 2016 and will host weddings, funerals, and naming ceremonies. (Did you hear about last year's Viking apocalypse?)

Their mission, like that of many other school-age kids, is simple: find Waldo.

The South Bend Tribune reported that, in this case, Waldo— the tall, brown-haired man with a white-and-red striped shirt and hat— is an 8-foot-tall wooden cutout that construction worker Jason Haney hides around the construction site. Each time a child finds Waldo, a hospital worker informs Haney, he hides the cutout again, and the search starts over.

“It gives us something to talk about,” Tracy Byler, coordinator of the Child Life Program at Memorial Children’s Hospital, told the newspaper. “A big part of what we want to do is build relationships, so anything that gives us a chance to talk, like ‘Where’s Waldo,’ is great.”

Haney, who is working for general contractor J.J. White on Memorial’s $50 million expansion, came up with the idea after hospitalized children and their families liked a snowman that Haney’s team built last winter.

The South Bend Tribune reported that Haney also finds getting the children’s minds off treatment is rewarding. When his daughter Taylor was 3, she suffered a stroke. Taylor surpassed doctors’ expectations to graduate high school and plans to attend Ball State University. She helped her dad paint Waldo, the newspaper reported.

Some of the children follow Waldo’s journey on the Facebook page “Where’s Waldo: Memorial Children’s Hospital,” which the hospital maintains.

Arabian Business reports that scientists are studying the feasibility of creating a man-made mountain. Experts from the U.S.-based University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) are undertaking a “detailed modelling study” of the project, according to NCAR scientist Roelof Bruintjes, lead researcher on the project.

“What we are looking at is basically evaluating the effects on weather through the type of mountain, how high it should be and how the slopes should be,” Bruintjes told Arabian Business. “We will have a report of the first phase this summer as an initial step.”

Arabian Business reports that, working with UAE’s National Center of Meteorology and Seismology, the UCAR received $400,000 funding last year to propose the man-made mountain study.

Bruintjes noted that mountains make air rise, creating clouds that can be ‘seeded.’ An established method of weather modification, cloud seeding involves injecting silver iodide droplets into clouds. Water coalesces around the droplets, causing precipitation.

China, for example, used cloud seeding in attempt to clear the skies and improve air quality for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. However, the effectiveness of cloud seeding continues to be debated in science community.

Located at the southeast end of the Arabian Peninsula, the oil-rich UAE has monthly average rainfall of 5.7 mm, according to World Bank data.

The NCMS website notes that UAE is one of the first countries in the Arabian Gulf to use cloud seeding. Research has found that the best cloud seeding conditions occur during the summer in the eastern and southwestern parts of the UAE, according to the NCMS.

Experts are looking at potential heights, widths and different UAE locations for the mountain, Bruintjes told Arabian Business. The scientist added that, if the project gets a government go-ahead, an engineering company will be approached to find out whether building the mountain is feasible.

Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel said 14 people were injured and transported to area hospitals following a fiery blast at approximately 8:15 a.m. The victims have injuries ranging from burns to trauma. Some fell or jumped from the windows of the three-story building following the explosion.

Paramedics responded to find victims on the ground, some with injuries that suggested they may have fallen multiple stories. There were no reports of fatalities.

""It's not clear whether people were pushed out of the building from the explosion or whether they fell or jumped out of windows to escape,"" said Robert Ball, a spokesman for Hennepin County Emergency Medical Services.

Authorities weren't sure whether any residents were still inside. Assistant Minneapolis Fire Chief Cherie Penn said the roof had partially collapsed, and it was too dangerous for firefighters to enter and sweep the premises

Fruetel said the fire was essentially out by late Wednesday afternoon. He said none of the fire crew members was hurt, saying they did a great job under ""extreme conditions.""

Plumes of thick, whitish-gray smoke could be seen rising from the building, which has a grocery store on the ground floor and two levels of apartments above it. Flames could be seen through third-story windows, and the frigid air was filled was the acrid smell of smoke.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation. ""We don’t know the reason for the fire,"" Fruetel told reporters during a morning press conference.

Abdikadir Mohamed, whose uncle owns the grocery store, watched the scene in silence, struggling to put his thoughts into words.

""This is bad,"" he said.

Firefighting efforts were being hampered by the sub-zero temperatures. As firefighters aimed their hoses at the flames, water gushed from windows and doorways, forming icicles on window frames and leaving the street slick and icy.

The facade of the building and trees out front were also coated with a layer of ice.

Ball said the frosty conditions were creating an additional set of hazards for the 55 firefighters on the scene.

""While heat-related illnesses are common for firefighters, now you combine that with the rapid onset of frostbite or hypothermia when they come out and they're wet and exposed to bitter cold temperatures,"" he said.

Fire officials appeared to get the fire under control about 11:30 a.m. Firefighters who had been aiming a hose at the flames from a truck-mounted crane shut off their water, and with smoke still billowing from the roof, other investigators began to approach the front door.

Outgoing Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak told reporters he was ""deeply concerned"" about the fire.

""I'm also deeply grateful for the firefighters and other crews who came out here and kept it from getting worse,"" he said.

A mosque that is next door to the gutted building appeared to escape any obvious structural damage. Abdisalam Adam, the imam at Islamic Civic Society of America & Masjid Dar Al-Hijrah, watched the firefighting efforts and said he was praying for those affected by the fire.

""It's devastating and very sad,"" he said.

Wisconsin Reporter did a study of the 10 largest school districts in the state and found that, compared to Milwaukee, the nine others have a combined total of just five idle buildings, costing taxpayers about $83,000 a year.

MPS spokesman Anthony Tagliavia partly attributes that difference to the Milwaukee district having the biggest facility inventory and the greatest number of students.

But dwindling enrollment also is undoubtedly playing a role.

MPS, which consists of numerous low-performing schools, has seen its student population drop from 92,395 in 2005-06 to an estimated 78,599 in 2013-14, according to data from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.

Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist, was part of the president’s health care reform team for two years and is the brother of former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.

“We grandfathered in plans,” Emanuel said.

Host Chris Wallace pressed Emanuel to defend the growing number of cancellation notices sent to people whose plans changed after the law was implemented, but Emanuel could not.

Instead, he blamed much of the problems on insurance companies and not the new law.

“The law does not say ‘Sears drop coverage!’ Sears decides what’s good for Sears,” Emanuel said. “The insurance decides how to make money. When the private companies decide to drop an individual, you blame Obama. He isn’t responsible for that.”

Wallace’s other guest in the segment, James Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, called the grandfather clause in ObamaCare too narrow, adding that “the whole point of the exchanges was to close down the individual insurance market.”

Capretta called out Obama’s pitch to the public about the benefits of the plan and repeated pledges that Americans would be able to keep their current insurance providers if they liked it misleading and says Obama should shoulder the blame.

“There’s no extenuating circumstances,” Capretta said. “It was central to passing the law. He said clearly you can keep your plan. This wasn’t a minor pledge. It was central to the law. He broke that pledge.”

Capretta said the Obama administration “shouldn’t be able to play fast and loose” with people’s medical coverage.

In recent days, a growing number of Democrats have joined Republicans calling to extend the March 31 deadline to sign up for health insurance. They argue that the White House should extend the deadline to make sure that people who want it have enough time to buy it.

Capretta suggested “delaying the whole thing for a year.”

“(Americans) will have a full four months to sign up,” Emanuel said. “You can’t prejudge now.” White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer added a new twist to Obama’s pledge to millions of Americans that they could keep their insurance if they like it.

“[People who are happy with their insurance] can keep it, if it hasn’t been changed or canceled,” he said on ABC’s “This Week” with George Stephanopoulos.

In the days that followed the Oct. 1 rollout, the site has been riddled with problems.

The ObamaCare website shut down Saturday night for “extended” repairs, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Technicians have shut down HealthCare.gov during weekends since the site launched Oct. 1, but just for a few overnight hours.

""The HealthCare.gov tech team is performing extended maintenance this weekend to improve network infrastructure and make enhancements to the online application and enrollment tools,” agency spokeswoman Joanne Peters said Saturday.

Last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified during a congressional hearing that officials are working “24-7” to improve the health insurance website HealthCare.gov. The online portal debuted on Oct. 1 to mostly negative reviews over glitches in the system.

The website was designed to allow people to sign in and sign up for insurance in their state.

It is a part of Obama’s signature health care overhaul. The law, which was passed with no GOP support, was signed by the president in 2010 as a way to fix the nation’s ailing health care system and providing insurance to millions of people who couldn’t afford it.

Sebelius was grilled for three hours last week by lawmakers who wanted to know why there were so many problems with the system. Sebelius took most of the blame for the botched debut.

Jeffrey Zients, a former White House budget deputy, has said the site will be fixed by the end of the month. Sebelius has also said she feels confident about the Nov. 30 re-launch.

Workers will erect steel columns that will make its unfinished skeleton a little over 1,250 feet high, just enough to peak over the roof of the observation deck on the Empire State Building.

The milestone is a preliminary one. Workers are still adding floors to the so-called ""Freedom Tower"" and it isn't expected to reach its full height for at least another year, at which point it is likely to be declared the tallest building in the U.S., and third tallest in the world.

Those bragging rights, though, will carry an asterisk.

Crowning the world's tallest buildings is a little like picking the heavyweight champion in boxing. There is often disagreement about who deserves the belt.

In this case, the issue involves the 408-foot-tall needle that will sit on the tower's roof.

Count it, and the World Trade Center is back on top. Otherwise, it will have to settle for No. 2, after the Willis Tower in Chicago.

""Height is complicated,"" said Nathaniel Hollister, a spokesman for The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitats, a Chicago-based organization considered an authority on such records.

Experts and architects have long disagreed about where to stop measuring super-tall buildings outfitted with masts, spires and antennas that extend far above the roof.

Consider the case of the Empire State Building: Measured from the sidewalk to the tip of its needle-like antenna, the granddaddy of all super-tall skyscrapers actually stands 1,454 feet high, well above the mark being surpassed by One World Trade Center on Monday.

Purists, though, say antennas shouldn't count when determining building height.

An antenna, they say, is more like furniture than a piece of architecture. Like a chair sitting on a rooftop, an antenna can be attached or removed. The Empire State Building didn't even get its distinctive antenna until 1952. The record books, as the argument goes, shouldn't change every time someone installs a new satellite dish.

Excluding the antenna brings the Empire State Building's total height to 1,250 feet. That was still high enough to make the skyscraper the world's tallest from 1931 until 1972.

From that height, the Empire State seems to tower over the second tallest completed building in New York, the Bank of America Tower.

Yet, in many record books, the two skyscrapers are separated by just 50 feet.

That's because the tall, thin mast on top of the Bank of America building isn't an antenna, but a decorative spire.

Unlike antennas, record-keepers like spires. It's a tradition that harkens back to a time when the tallest buildings in many European cities were cathedrals. Groups like the Council on Tall Buildings, and Emporis, a building data provider in Germany, both count spires when measuring the total height of a building, even if that spire happens to look exactly like an antenna.

This quirk in the record books has benefited buildings like Chicago's recently opened Trump International Hotel and Tower. It is routinely listed as being between 119 feet to 139 feet taller than the Empire State Building, thanks to the antenna-like mast that sits on its roof, even though the average person, looking at the two buildings side by side, would probably judge the New York skyscraper to be taller.

The same factors apply to measuring the height of One World Trade Center.

Designs call for the tower's roof to stand at 1,368 feet -- the same height as the north tower of the original World Trade Center. The building's roof will be topped with a 408-foot, cable-stayed mast, making the total height of the structure a symbolic 1,776 feet. The U.S. Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776.

So is that needle an antenna or a spire?

""Not sure,"" wrote Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the building.

The needle will, indeed, function as a broadcast antenna. It is described on the Port Authority's website as an antenna. On the other hand, the structure will have more meat to it than your average antenna, with external cladding encasing the broadcast mast.

Without that spire, One World Trade Center would still be smaller than the Willis Tower in Chicago, formerly known as the Sears Tower, which tops out at 1,451 feet (not including its own antennas).

Debate over which of those buildings can truly claim to be the tallest in the U.S. has been raging for years on Internet message boards frequented by skyscraper enthusiasts.

As for the Council on Tall Buildings, it is leaning toward giving One World Trade the benefit of the doubt.

""This is something we have discussed with the architect,"" Hollister said. ""As we understand it, the needle is an architectural spire which happens to enclose an antenna. We would thus count it as part of the architectural height.""

But, he noted, the organization has also chosen to sidestep these types of disputes, somewhat, by recognizing three types of height records: tallest occupied floor, architectural top, and height to the tip.

Hollister also pointed out that, technically speaking, One World Trade Center isn't a record-holder in any category yet, as it is still unfinished.

""A project is not considered a building until it is topped out, fully clad, and open for business or at least occupiable,"" he said.

The debate doesn't quite end there.

Neither of the Willis Tower nor One World Trade are as high as the CN Tower, in Toronto, which stands at 1,815 feet. That structure, however, isn't considered a building at all by most record-keepers, because it is predominantly a television broadcast antenna and observation platform with very little interior space. The tallest manmade structure in the Western Hemisphere will continue to be the 2,063-foot-tall KVLY-TV antenna in Blanchard, North Dakota.

As for the world's tallest building, the undisputed champion is the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, which opened in 2010 and reaches 2,717 feet.

Not counting about 5 feet of aircraft lights and other equipment perched on top, of course.","One World Trade Center, the giant monolith being built to replace the twin towers destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks, will lay claim to the title of New York City's tallest skyscraper on Monday.

Fox411.com's Pop Tarts column has learned that Houston was a mess when she showed up to Hollywood hotspot Playhouse on Feb. 2 around 10.30pm to support her on again/off again boyfriend Ray J, who took over the turntables as guest DJ.

""She was a total wreck. She drank cognac and champagne, and seemed completely out of it from the moment she arrived until the moment she left,"" an insider told FOX411's Pop Tarts column. ""Yet at the same time she seemed like she was enjoying herself with her friends. She went to the smoking patio a few times throughout the night and was also seen roaming around throughout the club and even ventured walking upstairs to the smaller room.""

Apparently Houston, who stayed until 2.30am, continually left her VIP booth, although it was unclear why or what she was doing while in the club. According to our insider, Houston was still very close to Ray J, his sister Brandy Norwood, and their family.

A week later, in the days before her death, similar scenes were reported.

People.com reported that Houston, notoriously plagued by drug demons in recent years, raised eyebrows after checking into the Beverly Hills Hilton on Wednesday, and appeared ""out of it."" Over the course of the next few days, the pop diva was spotted looking noticeably disheveled with wet hair and mismatched clothes, waving her arms around frantically and wandering aimlessly through the hotel, all while smelling of alcohol and cigarettes.

Houston behaved similarly Thursday night when she helped coach Ray J's sister Brandy for her upcoming Grammy performance, according to the L.A. Times.

And in what turned out to be her last ever performance on Thursday night, Houston was seen acting erratically, looking worse for wear with blood dripping down her leg, at a pre-Grammy bash for Kelly Price at the club Tru Hollywood. Multiple reports suggested she got into a tequila-fueled confrontation with former ""X-Factor"" star Stacy Francis after finding Ray J chatting with Francis.

TMZ also reported that Houston and her personal posse ""partied heavily"" on Friday night in the bar at the Beverly Hills Hilton, where she was found dead in her room the next day.

What could be better than getting home from school, suiting up and heading down to the park with your skates slung over your shoulder? These days ice skating isn't so simple. Like most modern recreation, it involves driving, membership fees, limited hours and, of course, lots of rules. Worst of all, it's indoors, and anyone who likes winter sports knows that being out there in the cold air is what it's all about. A backyard skating rink instantly brings back the magic of outdoor ice skating-and it's a great way to get the kids out of the house during those long days of winter breaks.

Whether your goal is to foster the next Gretzky or Hamill, or if you just plan to slide around in your boots with the little ones (and try not to break your hip), you can build your own rink in a few different ways. The traditional method is to create a packed snow bank encircling the rink and then flood the interior with water. The drawback of this design is that unless you live near or north of Fargo, warm winter days will undermine the banks and let out any melted ice (water, that is). At the other end of the spectrum, you can purchase prefab ice rink materials and accessories a la carte or as in-a-box sets. You can even buy refrigerated systems for extending the skating season into the spring (ironically, thanks to all the electricity you'd be using, spring might come a little earlier each year). But the best type of rink for most DIYers is, like so many homegrown projects, made with good old plywood.

In this case, ""modular"" means that you can build the rink walls in sections for easy transport and storage. Start by ripping full 4 x 8-foot sheets of 3/4-inch CDX (exterior) plywood into planks anywhere from about 8 to 24 inches wide. For each 8-foot section of wall, build four triangular braces, using 2x6 lumber. The front (wall-side) and bottom legs of the triangle form a right angle, while the third leg runs at a 45-degree angle between the top and bottom legs. If desired, paint the plywood and braces with two coats of exterior house paint (preferably white, so it blends in with your backyard winter wonderland).

Fasten the plywood planks to the braces with deck screws, spacing the braces about 2 feet apart. Position one outside brace so it overhangs the end of each panel by 2-3/4 inches (half the width of a 2x6), and set the other outside brace 2-3/4 inches in from the opposite panel edge; this allows you to overlap and secure adjacent wall sections when assembling the rink. Add lumber blocking behind the panel edges that will form the corners of the rink. You can also build 4-foot-long wall sections, each with three braces, for forming corners or fitting your rink space, as needed.

Fit the wall sections together to create the rink perimeter, joining adjacent sections by screwing along the overlapping joints. Cover the entire rink in a single sheet of 6-mil clear plastic sheeting (it's available in huge pieces through specialty plastics suppliers and retailers of backyard ice rink equipment). Drape the plastic along the inside face and up and over the wall sections. Flood the rink interior with water to a minimum depth of 2 inches. If your yard slopes, the ice will be thicker in the lower areas, but that's ok; it just takes more water. Let the water freeze completely and you're ready to skate. Rewet the rink as needed to smooth the ice (there's no need to shop for a secondhand Zamboni).

You can cover the top edges of the plywood wall panels with foam pipe insulation. Just slit the insulation tubes with a utility knife, cutting through just one wall of the tube in a straight line. Slip the tubes over the plywood edges, butting the tubes end-to-end to create a continuous safety rail. If your rink will be used for hockey or any other activity involving speeding projectiles, protect your house from flying pucks, either with tall rink walls or by locating the rink a safe distance away the house (and from your neighbors' houses).

With all the hockey nuts in this country (and many, many more in Canada and other wintry areas), you can find loads of additional planning and construction advice for backyard rinks online. One of my favorites is mybackyardicerink.com. Happy skating!

Like most modern recreation, it involves driving, membership fees, limited hours and, of course, lots of rules. Worst of all, it's indoors, and anyone who likes winter sports knows that being out there in the cold air is what it's all about.

The assailant was killed.

The shooting Sunday evening is the most recent in a growing number of attacks this year by Afghans working with the country's international allies. Some assailants have turned out to be Taliban sleeper agents, while others have been motivated by personal grievances.

Gunfire was first heard sometime after 8 p.m. local time around the former Ariana Hotel, a building that ex-U.S. intelligence officials said is the CIA station in Kabul. The spy agency occupied the heavily secured building just blocks from the Afghan presidential palace in late 2001 after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the Taliban.

A U.S. official in Washington said the American who died was a CIA employee. The official requested anonymity because he was speaking about intelligence matters.

The U.S. Embassy said an Afghan employee of the complex carried out the attack.

""The motivation for the attack is still under investigation,"" the embassy said in a statement. Embassy spokesman Gavin Sundwall declined to comment on what the targeted annex was used for, citing security reasons. Sundwall said the Afghan employee was not authorized to carry a weapon, and it was not clear how the man was able to get a gun into the secured compound.

The embassy did not provide information on the American who was killed, and said the person wounded in the shooting was taken to a military hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. It said the embassy has ""resumed business operations.""

The attack came less than two weeks after militants fired rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles at the U.S. Embassy, NATO headquarters and other buildings in Kabul, killing seven Afghans. No embassy or NATO staff members were hurt in the 20-hour assault. But it plunged U.S.-Pakistan relations to new lows as U.S. officials accused Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency of supporting insurgents in planning and executing the Sept. 13 attack.

Sunday's assault also follows closely on last week's assassination of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was leading a government effort to broker peace with the Taliban.

He was killed when an insurgent claiming to be a peace emissary detonated a bomb hidden in his turban upon meeting Rabbani.

President Hamid Karzai called Rabbani's death a ""big loss"" and said greater security measures should be taken to protect top Afghan figures, including religious clerics and tribal leaders. A government spokesman said the man who brought the suicide bomber to Kabul has been arrested.

NATO bases and embassies have ramped up security following a number of attacks over the past year by Afghan security forces against their counterparts. Since March 2009, the coalition has recorded at least 20 incidents where a member of the Afghan security forces or someone wearing a uniform used by them killed coalition forces.

Thirty-six coalition troops have died in the attacks. It is not known how many of the 282,000 members of the Afghan security forces were killed.

In December 2009, an al-Qaida double agent blew himself up at a CIA base in eastern Khost province, killing seven CIA employees. The attacker, a Jordanian man named Humam al-Balawi, had been brought into the base because he claimed to be able to reach high-level al-Qaida leaders.

Meanwhile, political tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan continued to mount Monday. The Afghan Foreign Ministry warned Pakistan that if cross-border artillery attacks hitting eastern Afghanistan continue, relations between the countries will suffer.

The Afghan government has said that an unknown number of Afghan civilians have been killed by the shelling coming from Pakistani territory in recent days. The attacks have allegedly destroyed several houses and mosques and displaced hundreds of people.

The Foreign Ministry quoted Mohammad Sadeq, Pakistan's ambassador in Kabul, as saying that the attacks were not intentional and that he regretted the killings and the destruction of property.

The Pakistani Embassy in Kabul could not immediately confirm the statement.

The Afghan censure comes as U.S. officials have sharpened their missives to Pakistan over the past week and half, drawing more direct lines between the government and the Haqqani network, which is affiliated with the Taliban and al-Qaida and is often blamed for attacks in Kabul.

NATO said Monday that its operations in the east in the past four months have killed more than 450 enemy fighters but that it is clear that the Haqqanis, who control large areas in the east, are still operating out of Pakistan.

""We have no credible intelligence indicating that the Haqqani network has eliminated their operating safe havens in Pakistan,"" said Brig. Gen. Carsten Jacobson, a spokesman for NATO forces in Afghanistan. ""They continue to plan and execute operations from across the border.""

In the south on Monday, a NATO service member was killed in a bomb attack, making a total of 38 international troopers killed so far this month.","A building used by the CIA in Kabul came under attack Sunday, U.S. and Afghan officials said, the latest in a series of attacks in the Afghan capital.",30.935483871,0.9032258065000001,1.4838709677000002,medium,medium,abstractive,architecture

The pictures were taken on April 20 and indicate Pakistan is building a fourth nuclear reactor to produce plutonium.

Paul Brannan, a nuclear analyst with the Institute for Science and International Security, explains how U.S. officials and other nuclear experts have been able to document the alarming expansion of Pakistan’s nuclear program in the past two years.

“They have a telltale sign,” Brannan said, looking at the images. “I mean you can see the square of the reactor building, you can see the inner square of the reactor hall where the actual reactor goes, and if you measure the dimensions of the building it matches up exactly to the second and the third reactors.”

In 2009 it was a barren site.

Pakistan first revealed the Khushab site and its plutonium production facility in 1998 after the country’s first nuclear test. That is when Pakistan’s official nuclear program turned from the highly enriched uranium model established by the father of that program, A.Q. Khan, to plutonium production. Plutonium weapons are lighter, more mobile and easier to deliver than those based on highly enriched uranium.

Pakistan already has 100 nuclear weapons. Experts, such as Brannan, say that the new reactors could give Pakistan enough fissile material to build somewhere between eight and 20 more nuclear weapons per year.

But it’s the cost of the reactors and the speed at which they have been built in the last two years that is raising eyebrows. Just how high is the cost? “It would be in the billions,” Brannan said. “This is a military reactor. It's outside of the civilian program.”

U.S. officials have been watching the Khushab facility for some time, but say there is no good explanation how Pakistan is paying for this. The United States has given Pakistan $20 billion in military and economic aid since September 11, 2001. Sen. John Kerry, who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, returned from Islamabad Tuesday morning after Pakistan agreed to return the stealth helicopter tail of the downed Blackhawk MH-60 damaged in the raid that killed Usama bin Laden.

On Tuesday, Kerry warned against cutting off aid to Pakistan.

“Right now, we have about 100,000 reasons for worrying about our relationship with Pakistan,” Kerry said during a hearing with former National Security Adviser Gen. Jim Jones. “And they're called our young men and women, and they're in uniform in Afghanistan.”

Pakistan controls 70 percent of the supply routes into Afghanistan, according to Pentagon officials. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and others have warned that cutting off relations or aid to Pakistan would be dangerous because the government and military of Pakistan could fall under more influence from Islamic radicals who are sympathetic to Al Qaeda and those proliferating nuclear weapons could fall into the wrong hands.",Recent satellite images obtained by Fox News from the aerial imagery company GEOEYE show an expanding nuclear facility at the Khushab facility about 100 miles south of Pakistan's capital city of Islamabad.,16.8235294118,1.0,34.0,medium,high,extractive,architecture

Economic isolation is actually growing worse across the country, as more and more minority families find themselves trapped in high-poverty neighborhoods without decent housing, schools or jobs, and with few avenues of escape.

This did not happen by accident. It is a direct consequence of federal, state and local housing policies that encourage — indeed, subsidize — racial and economic segregation. Fair housing advocates have recently been encouraged by a Supreme Court decision and new federal rules they see as favorable to their cause. Even so, there will be no fundamental change without the dismantling of policies that isolate the poor and that Paul Jargowsky, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University-Camden, and others call the “architecture of segregation.”

As things stand now, federally subsidized housing for low-income citizens, which seems on its face to be a good thing, is disproportionately built in poor areas offering no work, underperforming schools and limited opportunity. Zoning laws in newer suburbs that rest on and benefit from infrastructure built with public subsidies prevent poor, moderate-income and minority families from moving in. Discriminatory practices exclude even higher income minority citizens from some communities.

The economic expansion of the 1990s brought wage increases and low unemployment, diluting poverty and cutting the number of people living in high-poverty neighborhoods by about 25 percent. Many policy experts believed at the time that the era of urban decay was coming to an end. But as Mr. Jargowsky observes, that’s not how things worked out. In a new analysis of census data, he finds that the number of people living in high-poverty slums, where 40 percent or more of the residents live below the poverty level, has nearly doubled since 2000.

Meanwhile, he writes, poverty has become more concentrated: More than one in four of the black poor, nearly one in six of the Hispanic poor and one in 13 of the white poor now live in a neighborhood of extreme poverty. Impoverished families are thus doubly disadvantaged — by poverty itself and by life in areas ravaged by the social problems that flow from it.

The Fair Housing Act was supposed to overcome these problems. But presidents in both parties declined to enforce it vigorously, and governments at all levels simply ignored it. No one knows that story better than former Vice President Walter Mondale, a co-sponsor of the act, who spoke eloquently at a fair housing conference at HUD on Tuesday.

“When high-income black families cannot qualify for a prime loan and are steered away from white suburbs, the goals of the Fair Housing Act are not fulfilled,” he said. “When the federal and state governments will pay to build new suburban highways, streets, sewers, schools and parks, but then allow these communities to exclude affordable housing and nonwhite citizens, the goals of the Fair Housing Act are not fulfilled. When we build most new subsidized housing in poor black or Latino neighborhoods, the goals of the Fair Housing Act are not fulfilled.”

Among the recent positive moves, in a June ruling the Supreme Court reminded state and local governments that housing discrimination is illegal even when unintentional and that the Fair Housing Act bars them from spending federal money in a manner that perpetuates segregation.

The following month, HUD ended decades of equivocation by issuing new rules under a provision of the act that requires state and local governments to “affirmatively further” fair housing goals by making legitimate efforts to replace “segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns.”

These actions, plus growing concern over racial isolation in places like Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, have inspired hope among fair housing advocates. But given the high social costs of entrenched segregation, governments at all levels must do far more.",The fight against the interlinked scourges of housing discrimination and racial segregation in America is far from finished.,40.7368421053,1.0,19.0,high,high,extractive,architecture

Ronan, Architect of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Dies at 101",1970-01-01 00:33:34.101919,"William J. Ronan, the architect and first chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and one of the most powerful officials in the modern history of New York State, died on Wednesday at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 101.

His death was confirmed by his daughter Diana Ronan Quasha.

Though Dr. Ronan, a political scientist, never held elected office, he left his stamp on many institutions, including the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where he was chairman after leaving the transportation authority, and New York University, where he was a professor and dean.

With the blessing of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, whom he long served as a close aide and adviser, Dr. Ronan engineered the state’s takeover of the Long Island Rail Road and then outmaneuvered Robert Moses, the master builder of highways, bridges and parks, to secure the takeover of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and the New York City Transit Authority.

That move took effect in 1968 with the creation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which now runs the New York City region’s subways, buses and commuter railroads. The agency allowed for highway tolls to subsidize all three, guaranteeing a bountiful stream of money that remains the linchpin of the region’s mass transit financing. So encompassing was Dr. Ronan’s influence and the authority’s scope that critics called it the “Wholly Ronan Empire.”

Tall, brainy and brusque, Dr. Ronan was a tenacious and astute student of politics. He made enemies but dazzled his admirers with his skill at preserving and enlarging his bureaucratic turf. He was more at ease, and arguably more effective, behind the scenes than in the public eye.

As chairman of the transportation authority, Dr. Ronan became the face of the transit system and the target of riders’ frustration. He was the subject of subway graffiti, and angry Long Island commuters hanged him in effigy.

“He was able to take the lumps, and, God almighty, he used to get lumps,” said Sidney J. Frigand, who was an aide and spokesman for Dr. Ronan from 1967 to 1973. “Building the M.T.A., consolidating all the transportation entities, took a tremendous amount of fortitude.”

Dr. Ronan presided over two tumultuous increases in the subway fare: to 30 cents from 20 cents in 1970, and to 35 cents in 1972 (about $2 in today’s money). After the first increase, he received death threats, and the police detailed detectives to protect him. “I was at one point probably the most hated man in New York,” he recalled in a 2005 interview for this obituary.

William John Ronan was born in Buffalo on Nov. 8, 1912, a child of Irish-Alsatian ancestry who grew up in an Episcopal family of fervent Democrats. (He later described himself as a “Rockefeller Republican.”) His father, William, was a businessman, and his mother, the former Charlotte Ramp, was a homemaker.

Mr. Ronan graduated magna cum laude from Syracuse University in 1934 and began teaching at N.Y.U. four years later. After completing his doctorate, in 1940, he was promptly hired as an assistant professor of government. He took a leave of absence during World War II to work as an aide in the State Department and then as a lieutenant in the Navy.

He resumed teaching after the war and became a full professor in 1947. From 1953 to 1958, he was dean of what is now the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at the university — named for a mayor whom Dr. Ronan briefly served as first deputy city administrator.

Dr. Ronan’s first foray into state government came in 1956, when Gov. W. Averell Harriman appointed Mr. Rockefeller chairman of a commission to examine the state constitution. Mr. Rockefeller named Dr. Ronan the commission’s executive director. Mr. Rockefeller was elected governor two years later and made Dr. Ronan secretary to the governor, in effect the chief of staff and top administrative officer.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority evolved from the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority, which the Legislature created in 1965 to buy and run the financially troubled Long Island Rail Road. In 1966, Dr. Ronan resigned as secretary to the governor to devote his full time to the fledgling agency.

Mr. Rockefeller and Dr. Ronan pushed for a regional transportation agency over the objections of Mr. Moses, the chairman of the profitable bridge and tunnel authority. He described the plan as “grotesque” and “absurd.” Mayor John V. Lindsay also opposed the state takeover of the city’s subways. But Mr. Rockefeller and Dr. Ronan prevailed, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was born on March 1, 1968.

The next six years were hard ones for Dr. Ronan, who inherited the chronic problems — vandalism, declining ridership and disinvestment — that would plague the transit system until the 1990s.

“We’re making up for 30 years of do-nothingism in mass transportation,” he said in a 1968 interview.

He laid out an ambitious expansion agenda that called for a subway line under Second Avenue, a connection from the Long Island Rail Road to the East Side of Manhattan and the construction of a new subway tunnel under 63rd Street. The first two projects, long dormant, were revived in 2000 and are under construction; the third project was completed in 2001.

Dr. Ronan’s successes in Albany did not translate to popular support for mass transit. In 1967, voters approved a $2.5 billion state bond issue for transportation, but they rejected similar measures in 1971 and 1973. As the city’s fiscal crisis deepened, construction of the Second Avenue subway came to a halt.

He laid the groundwork for the creation of the Metro-North Railroad by acquiring, from the Penn Central Railroad, the New Haven line in 1971 and the Harlem and Hudson lines in 1972. Metro-North went into operation in 1983.

But far from expanding under Dr. Ronan, the subway system actually contracted: The Myrtle Avenue El in Brooklyn shut down in 1969, the Third Avenue El in the Bronx in 1973. When he stepped down in 1974 to become chairman of the Port Authority, The New York Times described him as “the quintessential civil servant” but also as “a transportation mendicant.”

Dr. Ronan’s tenure at the Port Authority was less successful than at the transportation agency.

“His tendency to comment disparagingly about his fellow board members and a sometimes arrogant style undercut his efforts,” the political scientist Jameson W. Doig wrote in “Empire on the Hudson,” a 2001 history of the Port Authority.

There was also the matter of lavish travel expenses. The Times reported in 1977 that Dr. Ronan and other Port Authority officials were flying first-class on business trips abroad (with the agency covering their spouses’ expenses) and had turned the agency’s three helicopters into a “private air force.”

Nonetheless, Dr. Ronan oversaw the addition of a million square feet of cargo space at Kennedy International Airport, the opening of the Journal Square transit hub in Jersey City and a major expansion of the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan. He stepped down as chairman in 1977 but stayed on the board until 1990. He remained a senior adviser to the Rockefeller family until 1980.

Besides his daughter Diana, Dr. Ronan is survived by another daughter, Monica V. Ronan; his partner, Bette Machon; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. Dr. Ronan’s wife of 57 years, the former Elena Vinadé, died in 1996.

After leaving public life, Dr. Ronan was a management consultant and adviser to transportation companies, government agencies and nonprofit organizations and served on several corporate boards. He divided his time among West Palm Beach, New York and St.-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, France.

Dr. Ronan was loath to be defined by his government work. (A 1968 “Man in the News” profile in The Times described him as “an avid reader of history” who “enjoys the theater and the opera, swimming and golf.”) And he would insist that moving from the halls of academia to the corridors of government power was not always easy for him.

“Some have occupations thrust upon them,” he told The Times, “and in a sense that’s what happened to me.”

Yehuda E. Safran organized the show on Adolf Loos at Columbia.

Adolf Loos, the enigmatic Moravian-born architect, is better known for his writings than his buildings. A century after the publication of his polemical essay âOrnament and Crime,â a Columbia University exhibition called âAdolf Loos: Our Contemporaryâ examines his enduring relevance. Loos provoked a furor in 1910 with the severe facade of a menâs tailoring shop and apartment block facing the imperial palace in Vienna. It became known as âthe house without eyebrowsâ for its lack of decoration, and Emperor Franz Josef was said to have drawn his carriage curtains when he rode past. By contrast, Le Corbusier acknowledged the Modern movementâs debt to Loos, saying he âscrubbed under our feet; it was a Homeric cleansing â precise, philosophical and logical.â Yehuda E. Safran, who organized the show, had more to say about him. (This interview has been condensed and edited.)

Connect with us at @NYTimesHome for articles and slide shows on interior design and life at home.

From left, a model of âBuilding H,â by Ãlvaro Siza, who was inspired by Loos; Loosâs Tristan Tzara House, 15 Avenue Junot in Paris, 1925-6; and Eileen Grey, Three-Story House after Adolf Loosâs Villa Alexander Moissi, Lido de Venezia, Italy, 1923.

Q. You interviewed influential architects around the world about Loos. What did you find?Â

A. They were united in one thing: that Loos inspired them to keep a critical point of view, to take nothing for granted and to realize that architecture has its value insofar as it is a thought, not merely a thing.

Is this a difficult message now, when buildings are expected to make a huge visual splash?

In this respect Loosâs argument is not popular, but among the best architects it prevails.

Why has âornament and crimeâ so often been misunderstood?

The essay developed out of a long series of lectures where he had to defend himself to authorities who refused a permit for the building opposite the palace. The authorities finally agreed to certify the building, provided flowerpots were attached to the windows. The Viennese public perceived the building as a kind of threat to their standing, to their way of life, to their basic beliefs.

Then it was used by modernists to promote minimalist design?

Yes and no, because after all, Loos never argued for the lack of ornament. He argued for the appropriate ornament. He believed itâs better to find the ornament in what exists already, to find ornament in material, for example in the surface of marble, the surface of different woods. If you see the photo of his own apartment, you see the carpets, the curtains, et cetera. One could by no stretch of the imagination see this as a lack of ornament.

Thereâs no contradiction. When the lack of ornament was more radically taken up by the Bauhaus, Loos was famous for having said that they made the lack of ornament into a new kind of ornament. Loos never contemplated a world bare of ornament.

In a book of essays accompanying the show, the Princeton historian Beatriz Colomina termed Loosâs obsession with design purity a âdisplacementâ related to his sexual proclivities â he was briefly imprisoned for sex with minors â and said his critique of ornamentation stemmed from homophobia. Do you agree?

I love Colominaâs proclivities for gossip and stimulating argument, but itâs totally unfounded. In Loosâs library the most important section was Oscar Wilde, so to say that Loos is homophobic is absurd. He had many liabilities. Nobody could be referred to as without blemish. Who cares that he married three women that were so much younger than him?

What should people take away from this exhibition?

The inspiration for it came from a great Polish man of the theater called Jan Kott, who published in the 1960s an incredible book called âShakespeare, Our Contemporary.â I have no illusion that Loos is the Shakespeare of architecture, but when you stage a Shakespeare play nowadays, nobody questions the wisdom of it, only what kind of interpretation.

Itâs very important for a new generation to appreciate how Loos has percolated throughout architecture culture ever since his death in 1933.Â

The film, based on Orson Scott Card’s 1985 novel, follows Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield), a gifted boy sent to military school in space in anticipation of an alien invasion. In the battle room, cadets navigate zero gravity much like Sandra Bullock in “Gravity” and compete in war games organized by Col. Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford). Here is a look at how their world is brought to life, as explained by the director, Gavin Hood (“X-Men Origins: Wolverine”), and the visual effects supervisor, Matthew Butler. — MEKADO MURPHY

The StarsThe large diamondlike metal objects that float in the battle room are called stars and are used strategically during the games, though in different configurations, depending on the challenge. The neon-looking triangles on each star sit underneath a handrail that cadets, like the one at near right, can grasp to steady themselves. Many of the stars were added digitally, but the team did build a few tangible ones. The crew built one for Ender’s friend Petra (Hailee Steinfeld) “that had a soft, rubberized surface so that we could slam Petra into it really hard for one shot,” Mr. Hood said. “But others were made of real metal.” Because the battle room scenes were often in low light, the filmmakers used the glow emanating from the stars to illuminate the actors. “There are 2,000 individual LEDs inside those stars,” he said.

The CadetsMaking it look as if the actors were weightless involved both physical and digital means. For this shot, Mr. Butterfield and Aramis Knight were fitted with harnesses, and, with the help of cables and motorized arms, suspended above the ground. The astronaut Greg Chamitoff (a former roommate of Mr. Butler’s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) advised the filmmakers on how to move. Even so, Mr. Butler had to digitally manipulate some of the footage to make the movement feel more fluid and weightless. “If you don’t do a completely smooth move, it can result in incorrect physics,” he said. “We stabilized the content and repositioned some of it.” Scattered around the frame are four other characters that are purely digital creations. That way, the effects artists could get the physics just right.

The EarthThe film is set in the future, but not a postapocalyptic one as far as Earth is concerned. Rather, Mr. Hood was interested in the concept of a “beautiful Earth,” as he called it: he wanted audiences to look at the planet and understand why aliens would covet its resources. “This was a dream of mine, to be able to look down and feel not only that I’m up in space but my planet is beautiful, rather than dystopian and miserable with everything falling to bits,” he said. He asked Mr. Butler and the visual effects crew to enhance the planet’s look ever so slightly to give this shot an even greater sense of wonder. The blue of the ocean grew bluer, and the sunlight reflecting on the water was heightened. “The movie has a lot of dark moments,” Mr. Hood said, “and it felt like we needed some moments of joy.”

The Battle RoomThe book describes the battle room as a square black box, “but for the movie I thought, we can’t go into space and be in a black box,” said Mr. Hood, who conceived the room’s look with the production designers Ben Procter and Sean Haworth. “Why don’t we put in a domed sphere, so when the characters jump out, it feels like they’ve pretty much jumped out into space?” This allowed for a view of Earth looming outside. But the background perspective changes with each battle game. “I really wanted to use the fact that I was in a glass dome as an opportunity to change the lighting with the mood each particular scene demanded,” Mr. Hood said. Mr. Butler and his effects team at Digital Domain worked out every computer-generated detail, down to the triangular panes of glass that compose the dome and how light reflects off them. “We had more than 300 shots in the zero-G room, so we needed to be able to build every part of it,” Mr. Butler said.","A look at the creation of the battle room for âEnderâs Game,â which required a combination of digital and physical special effects and scrupulous attention to physics.",28.7,0.7000000000000001,1.1,medium,low,abstractive,architecture

Not only was he recovering from a traumatic brain injury he sustained when an anti-tank mine exploded under his vehicle, the homebuilding career that Gallina had left behind just didn't seem to cut it anymore.

""I was dissatisfied with just building homes,"" Gallina says. ""I had a desire to give back… that my life not just be about building.""

After constructing a specially adapted home for his friend and ""battle buddy"" Dale Beatty, who lost both legs below the knee in the same explosion, a light bulb went off: Why not do the same for other veterans?

So the two men, each Purple Heart recipients, joined forces once again, this time to launch the aptly named Purple Heart Homes, Inc., dedicated to providing customized housing solutions for veterans of all ages.

""To be able to overcome our injuries, be a productive members of society and have something more meaningful in life to work for has been healing for the soul,"" says Gallina, whose Purple Heart has compelted six homes so far. ""It's a way of honoring those that you lost by caring for those who make it home.""

And just in time for the holidays, another young veteran injured in Iraq, from Tennessee, will also receive a new home, thanks to the Walmart Foundation. It announced Monday that Purple Heart would receive a $15,000 grant as part of its $1.5 million ""12 Days of Giving"" campaign on Facebook.

""I was blown way,"" Gallina says. ""Someone went onto Facebook and submitted our name as one of 5,400 contestants. I had no idea! This grant will have a huge impact on a veteran's life.""

The donation is part of company's $20 million commitment to veterans organizations through 2015.

Through hamburgers.,1970-01-01 00:33:34.051719,"President Obama has found a new way to invest in America's infrastructure: treating workers on a construction project to burgers.

Obama and Vice President Biden took four employees from a reconstruction project in Washington out to lunch at Shake Shack on Friday afternoon. The White House said the lunch -- a burger and fries for Obama; cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake for Biden -- comes after a week where they hit the road to highlight the need to increase investment in America's infrastructure. Doing so, they said, will create jobs and relieve congestion.

We didn't know that infrastructure investment involved chipping in for cheeseburgers and fries. But who doesn't love fries?

Obama took four workers from the First Stree NE reconstruction project in Washington's NOMA neighborhood. The $9.1 million project ($6.9 million of which came from federal aid) is expected to be completed this week.

""If Congress does not act by the end of the summer, we could have hundreds of projects like this stop,"" the president told reporters. The White House also nicely tied in their push to increase the minimum wage, with Obama telling reporters that they chose Shake Shack because it has ""great burgers and pays its employees more than 10 bucks an hour."" Obama was a bit hoarse and has been nursing a cold.

Meredith Upchurch, who works on stormwater management for the District of Columbia, was one of the four people invited. She said she and her colleagues didn't know they were meeting with Obama and Biden until they got to Shake Shack.

""It was pretty much, 'okay, what are we going to talk about?'"" she said in a phone interview. ""We were assured that the president and vice president would have plenty of questions.""

And they did, she said. As she ate a hamburger, she and her colleagues were peppered with queries about what they did on the project and how they thought infrastructure could be improved in Washington. Upchurch talked about the importance of cleaning up stormwater, and a colleague discussed LED lights.

""They both seemed knowledgeable about the topic and talked about it in other cities and states,"" she said. ""That's really good to hear, that’s a topic that’s high on the mind.""

So, are burgers the key to getting things done in D.C.? Who knows? At least four people got a (hopefully) free lunch out of the deal.

(D.C. Department of Real Estate Services) I didn’t get a chance earlier this week to give Harry Jaffe’s Tuesday Examiner column the debunking it deserves.

He supports an idea favored by D.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), whereby the city sells several of its downtown property holdings in order to cash in on strong real estate prices. Evans wants the city to look at selling the Frank D. Reeves Center at 14th and U streets NW; the Recorder of Deeds Building at 6th and D streets NW; the Henry J. Daly Building (aka police headquarters) at 4th Street and Indiana Avenue NW; and One Judiciary Square across the street.

Jaffe, in particular, favors selling One Judiciary Square, which, he notes, “sits right on top of the Metro, a short walk to Capitol Hill and the courthouses.”

The building would likely sell for several hundred million dollars. ”Salting that away into savings would bring the fund balance back over $1 billion,” Jaffe writes. “City bureaucrats would get a new building. Cranes would get busy. The new owner would pay taxes.”

So there are few immediate problems with this idea. Where would the many, many workers in that building go instead? Assuming they go into leased space, what would that do to the city’s operating budget? And where would the city find enough square footage for a decent price?

”You’d be exposed to more risk, and where would you go?” asks Robin-Eve Jasper, director of the city real estate department under former Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D).

Under Jasper and her predecessors, the city’s been on a mission to reduce the amount of leased space it occupies, not increase it. Leased space means less management burden for the city, but it’s expensive and risky, and the process of entering into leasing arrangements has been fraught with political meddling or worse.

Jasper said that of the four buildings Evans identifies, One Judiciary Square and Reeves make the least sense to sell because they are the largest and newest and full of city tenants and would be the hardest to replace on the leasing market. The Recorder of Deeds and Daly buildings, she said, are better candidates, and the city has explored public-private partnerships for redeveloping them.",DISTRICT OF DEBONIS | A former official comes out against a proposal to sell city-owned office buildings.,23.45,0.5,0.6000000000000001,medium,low,abstractive,architecture
